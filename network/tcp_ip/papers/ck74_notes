Notes on the paper "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication" by Vinton
G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn, IEEE Trans on Comms, Vol Com-22, No 5 May 1974

The subject of the paper is development of a common packet-switching network
protocol for communication between disparate connected computer networks, each
of which may each use its own internal protocols to communicate between hosts.
The inter-networking protocol described in this paper facilitates notional
end-to-end connections for transmitting data packets through a potentially
unreliable network of packet switches.  Detailed strategies for routing packets
through the network are beyond the scope of the paper.  The nascent protocol
introduced in this paper eventually led to the formal specifications of the TCP
and IP protocols.
