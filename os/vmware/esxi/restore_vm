Restoring a VM from backup files requires destroying the existing VM and
creating a new one:

In the ESXi web GUI:

Power off and delete the old VM.
In the Storage Datastore Browser, delete the old VM's directory.

Then from the main screen's Navigator window:

Host -> Create/Register VM
Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file
Enter the name for the virtual machine
Click on the box labeled "Click to select files or drag/drop" and upload
   the vmdk, mf, nvram, and ovf files
Click through the remaining screens, making selections as appropriate.
