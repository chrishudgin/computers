Create a password reset USB drive that runs the Offline Windows Password &
Registry Editor tool:

Format a USB thumb drive as FAT32.

Unzip all files from /archive/windows/win64/windows_7/utils/offline_windows_password_and_registry_editor/usb140201.zip onto the thumb drive.

In a command prompt window running with administrator privileges, cd to the top
level directory of the thumb drive and run syslinux.exe.  This makes the thumb
drive bootable.

Boot to the thumb drive and hit <Enter> at the "boot" prompt to start the
password reset utility menus.
