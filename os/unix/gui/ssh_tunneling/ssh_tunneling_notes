When connected to a remote X client system through ssh, "su -" will
   automatically preserve tunneled X authentication so the root user can use
   it, but "sudo -i" will not.  One solution is to root to run:
      # xauth merge ~chudgin/.Xauthority
   to merge the unprivileged user's X credentials.
