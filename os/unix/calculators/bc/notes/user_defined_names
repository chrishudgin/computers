The names of user-defined variables, arrays, and functions consist of a single
letter.  Because the syntax of the three entities listed above is unique to
each, the same letter can be used simultaneously for a variable, an array,
and/or a function without conflict or ambiguity.

Example, using >>> as a prompt for clarity:

>>> a=5+4
>>> a[3]=2
>>> define a(x) {
>>>	return (x^2)
>>> }

>>> a
9
>>> a[3]
2
>>> a(4)
16
