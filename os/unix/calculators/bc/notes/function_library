bc includes a library of mathematical functions implemented in the bc language
that are available if bc is run with the "-l" command-line option:

s(x) : sine of x
c(x) : cosine of x
a(x) : arctangent of x
l(x) : natural logarithm of x
e(x) : exponential function of x
j(n,x) : n-order Bessel function of x

When bc is invoked with the "-l" option, scale is automatically set to 20
rather than the default value of 0.
