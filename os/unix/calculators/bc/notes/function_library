bc includes a library of functions implemented in the bc language.

Three functions are built in:

sqrt(x) : square root of x
scale(x) : number of digits to the right of the decimal (base 10) point of x
length(x) : number of significant decimal (base 10) digits of x

Regardless of the input and output base in use, both scale(x) and length(x)
report a number of decimal (base 10) digits from the internal representation of
the number used as an argument.  The number reported will nevertheless be
expressed in the current output base.

The other included functions are available from a mathematical library when bc
is run with the "-l" command-line option:

s(x) : sine of x
c(x) : cosine of x
a(x) : arctangent of x
l(x) : natural logarithm of x
e(x) : exponential function of x
j(n,x) : n-order Bessel function of x

When bc is invoked with the "-l" option, the global scale is automatically set
to 20 rather than the default value of 0.
