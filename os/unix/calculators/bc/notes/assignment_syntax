bc in 7th Edition UNIX recognizes pre-ANSI C assignment/operation combination
operators such as =+ and =/ but not the equivalent ANSI C style combination
operators like += and /= .  Modern versions of bc recognize only the ANSI C
versions of the combination operator syntax, not the obsolete syntax.
