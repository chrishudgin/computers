bc supports "automatic" variables in functions as in C.  These variables are
declared with the "auto" keyword in the first line of a function and are
initialized to 0.  Each instantiation of a function (for example during
recursive calls) has its own independent set of automatic variables, again as
in C.  

Example:

define a(x){
	auto q, z
	q=2
	z = x^q
	return (z)
}
