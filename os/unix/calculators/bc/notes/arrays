Unlike dc, bc supports arrays directly using the same syntax as in C.

bc arrays are strictly one dimensional.

When an array is used as a function argument, a function parameter, or an
automatic variable, it is written as the array name followed by an empty
bracket pair.

Whole arrays cannot be function return values.

Example, with >>> as the prompt for clarity:

>>> define f(x[]){
>>>	auto y[]
>>>	y[2]=x[0]+x[1]
>>>	return (y[2])
>>> }
>>> a[0]=5
>>> a[1]=7
>>> f(a[])
12
