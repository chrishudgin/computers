With no arguments, bc takes its input from standard input.  Once a read from
standard input returns EOF, bc exits.

Unlike dc in 7th Edition UNIX, bc can take multiple filename arguments.  Their
contents are processed sequentially as a command list before standard input is
subsequently processed (by reading interactively from the terminal or, with
shell input redirection, non-interactively from a file).
