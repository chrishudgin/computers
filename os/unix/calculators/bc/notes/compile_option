Some versions of bc, including GNU bc and the version in 7th Edition UNIX but
not the versions in macOS or FreeBSD, have a "compile" (-c) command line option
to translate input into a lower-level form.  In 7th Edition UNIX, bc was
implemented as a front-end language compiler for dc, so the "-c" option
translates input into dc commands.  GNU bc has its own bytecode that is not in
dc syntax, so GNU bc compiles input into its native bytecode.  In GNU bc, the
"compile" option is mentioned in the man page but is described as being
undocumented.
