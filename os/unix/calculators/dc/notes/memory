dc supports multiple registers, each of which can contain a number, a string
(which may be an executable procedure), or a stack of numbers and/or strings.
Any single character can be used as the name of a register, thus providing at
leat 256 registers theoretically.  dc also provides a main (unnamed) stack.

Examples:

# Push 8 to stack.  Pop the top of the stack into register x.
8 sx 

# Push the command string "5 3 + p" to stack.  Pop the top of the stack into
# register x.
[5 3 + p] sx

# Push 8 to the register named "x", treating register "x" as a stack.
# Push 9 to the register named "x", treating register "x" as a stack.
# Push 5 to the main stack.
# Pop the top of register x's stack (9) and push it to the main stack.
# Pop the top two values on the main stack (9 and 5), multiply them, and push
#    the result (45) to the main stack.
# Pop the top of register x's stack (8) and push it to the main stack.
# Pop the top two values on the main stack (8 and 45), add them, and push
#    the result (53) to the main stack.
