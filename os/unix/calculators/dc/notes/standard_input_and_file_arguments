With no arguments, dc takes its input from standard input.  Once a read from
standard input returns EOF, dc exits.

dc in 7th Edition UNIX can take at most one filename argument, whose contents
are processed as a command list before standard input is subsequently processed
(by reading interactively from the terminal or, with shell input redirection,
non-interactively from a file).

In modern versions of dc such as the version in macOS or the GNU version in
Linux, dc can process multiple filename arguments sequentially as command
lists, but if filename arguments are given, standard input is not read and dc
exits as soon as all files given on the command line have been processed.
