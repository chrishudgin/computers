A string can be pushed to the stack using the [...] command.

Strings can be nested, as in [[some text]P]

Examples:

[* 3 +]
[This is a string that could be printed as an inline comment during execution.]

The "x" command pops a string from the stack and executes it as a sequence of
dc commands.

The "p" (lower case p) command prints (but does not pop) the top value on the
stack, whether it is a number or a string.

The "P" (capital P) command pops a string from the stack and prints it.  To be
printable, the string must be stored as ASCII characters, not a value stored as
a number.
