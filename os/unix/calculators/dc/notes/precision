dc allows arbitrary precision in any base.  The current precision is changed
with the "k" command which pops the top value (a non-negative integer) from the
stack and uses it as the "scale factor" (precision after radix point) for
fractional calculations and results.

The default precision is 0, meaning no digits after a radix point are used in
calculations or printed in results.  Effectively, this means dc operates in
integer math mode by default.

Example, using >>> as an input prompt for clarity:

>>> 3 7 / p
0
>>> 5 k
>>> 3 7 / p
.42857
