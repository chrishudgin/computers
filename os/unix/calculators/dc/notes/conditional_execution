Conditional execution in dc is accomplished with the <, >, and = commands.
Each is followed by a named register which contains a string of one or more dc
commands.  The commands stored in the register are executed if the comparison
relation is true for the top two elements of the stack, which are popped.  The
top element of the stack is used for the left hand side of the comparison, and
the next element is used for the right hand side.

Example (with ">>>" input prompt for clarity):
>>> [3 is less than 5.
>>> ]
>>> [P] sx 5 3 <x
3 is less than 5.
