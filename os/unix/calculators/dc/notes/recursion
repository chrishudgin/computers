Recursive procedures are possible by:

Pushing a string containing a command sequence to the stack ("[...]")
Duplicating it ("d")
Popping and executing it ("x")

if the command sequence itself contains a command to pop and execute the stack
again ("x")

Recursion can be limited by the use of the "q" and "Q" commands to move back
up a specified number of recursion levels.
