dc in 7th Edition UNIX is implemented internally with base-100 representation
of numbers, but input and output radices can be set arbitrarily to any integer
value between 1 and 16 inclusive.  Since the "o" command to set the output base
interprets the value it is given (from the stack) according to the current
input base, the output base should be set before the input base is changed if
both are to be modified using the same digits in the given value.

Examples:

# Set bases to 16 (i.e. hexadecimal), starting with output base
16 o
16 i

# Set bases to 16 (i.e. hexadecimal), starting with input base
16 i
10 o
# Since input base is 16, output base must be specified as hexadecimal 10
# which equals decimal 16.

*****

Hexadecimal numbers with digits A-F must use upper case for them since lower
case letters would collide with dc commands.
