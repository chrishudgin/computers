There are at least three ways to separate a string into its constituent
characters in AWK, for example to load into an array.

The examples below use the current line ($0) as the string to convert.

1.) The most portable way is to use the built-in substr function, as in:

for (i = 1; i <= length($0); i++) {
    a[i] = substr($0,i,1)
}

2.) A less portable way is to set FS to the null string "", then loop through
the resulting single character fields.

FS=""
for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
    a[i] = $i

3.) A third way, also not fully portable, is to use the built-in split function
with a null string as the separator:

n = split($0,a,"")

which creates the array of characters a[1]..a[n] from $0
