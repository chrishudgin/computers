The output of the print and printf commands can be redirected to a file or, on
Unix, to a pipe, as in these examples:

print("hello, world") > "output1"  # sends string to file "output1"
print("hello again, world") >> "output2"  # appends string to file "output2"
print("abc") | "tr 'abc' 'def'"  # sends output to Unix "tr" command
