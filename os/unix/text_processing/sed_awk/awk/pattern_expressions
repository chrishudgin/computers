V7 AWK requires a pattern to be a Boolean combination of regular expressions
and relational expressions, where a relational expression takes the form of:

	expression match_operator regular_expression
	expression relational_operator expression

and where a match operator is either ~ or !~ and a relational operator is ==,
!=, <, >, <=, or >=

This requirement in V7 AWK rules out the use of an arbitrary expression, such
as a plain number, as complete pattern.

In contrast, modern AWK implementations accept a more general pattern
expression syntax, allowing any expression that can be evaluated as zero or
nonzero to be used, indicating falsehood or truth, respectively (as in C).

Thus, in modern AWK, the following example patterns are valid:

0  # meaning always false
1  # meaning always true
