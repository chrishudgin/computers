When a field variable such as $1, $2, etc. is modified, $0 is also regenerated
using the modified field variable.  This allows such syntax as the following
action:

$1=$1

to cause leading whitespace in a line to be discarded, since $0 will be
regnerated starting at $1 which does not include leading whitespace.
