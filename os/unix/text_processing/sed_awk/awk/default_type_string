AWK will in most cases transparently convert a variable to a string or numeric
type whenever necessary, depending on context.  Use of a certain type (string
or numeric) can also be forced if needed:

myvar + 0   # forces resulting value to be numeric
myvar ""    # forces resulting value to be string

Without context information, AWK will treat a variable as a string, as in this
program:

$1 > $2 { print }
