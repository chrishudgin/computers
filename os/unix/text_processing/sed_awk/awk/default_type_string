AWK will in most cases transparently convert a variable to a string or numeric
type whenever necessary, depending on context.  For example:

print(length(4+5))    # adds 4 and 5, converts 9 to "9" for length(), prints 1
print(length(9+1))    # adds 9 and 1, converts 10 to "10" for length(), prints 2

Use of a certain type (string or numeric) can also be forced if needed:

myvar + 0   # forces resulting value to be numeric
myvar ""    # forces resulting value to be string

Without context information, AWK will treat a variable as a string, as in this
program:

$1 > $2 { print }
