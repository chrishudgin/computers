mawk buffers its input and will not process it until its input buffer is full
or until mawk terminates.  This can cause mawk to appear to be hung while it is
accumulating input (as from a pipe).

To force mawk to process its input immediately, as other AWK implementations
do, add the following option to the mawk command line:

-W interactive
