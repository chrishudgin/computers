AWK pattern ranges cannot consist of raw line numbers as they can in ed and sed
scripts.

To select a range of lines for an action, provided that the record separator RS
is set to the default value of newline ('\n'), use the NR variable as in this
example:

NR == 2, NR == 5 { print }   # prints input records (lines) 2 through 5
