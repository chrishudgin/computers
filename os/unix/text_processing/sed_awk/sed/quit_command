The sed "q" (quit) command ends the current cycle in the normal fashion (by
printing the pattern space unless the -n flag was used) and then quits sed.
The pattern space may include multiple lines if any were previously added to
the pattern space with the "N" command and not subsequently deleted.

Sed documentation often does not make it clear that the entire pattern space,
not necessarily just a single line, is by default (without -n) printed when a
cycle completes (including when the "q" command is run).  Some sed
documentation does not even mention that the "q" command causes a normal cycle
completion before qutting sed.
