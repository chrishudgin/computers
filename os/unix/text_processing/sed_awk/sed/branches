The branch commands "b" and "t" are typically used with an "N" or "n" command
between the label and the branch command to prevent the branch from causing an
infinite loop.  This works because the "N" or "n" command will end the sed
script when there are no more lines to read.

Alternatively, a context address (regular expression used as an address) can be
used as the address on which a series of commands ending in a branch operates
so that eventually (after reading with "N" and editing) the context address
will not match any line in the pattern space and the command series that
includes the branch will no longer be executed.
