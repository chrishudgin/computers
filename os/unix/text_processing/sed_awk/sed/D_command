The man page synopses of the "D" command's operation are sometimes incomplete
or confusing, failing to distinguish between starting a new cycle of commands
with the existing pattern space versus reading a new line of input and then
starting a new cycle, and not clearly explaining the circumstances under which
the "D" command operates as the "d" command does.

The GNU sed v4.8 documentation contains an accurate and complete description of
the "D" command's operation.

From https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#Other-Commands :

"D

If pattern space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle as if the d
command was issued. Otherwise, delete text in the pattern space up to the first
newline, and restart cycle with the resultant pattern space, without reading a
new line of input."
