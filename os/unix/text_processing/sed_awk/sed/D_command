The man page synopses of the "D" command's operation are sometimes incomplete
or confusing, failing to distinguish between starting a new cycle of commands
with the existing pattern space versus reading a new line of input and then
starting a new cycle, and not clearly explaining the circumstances under which
the "D" command operates as the "d" command does.

Here is an accurate and complete description of how the "D" command works:

Delete up through the first newline in the pattern space.  If the only newline
was the terminal newline, proceed as if the "d" command had been issued
(replace the pattern space with the next line and start the sequence of
commands again on that new pattern space).  Otherwise, restart the current
command sequence without reading the next line into the pattern space at this
time.
