Search for a repeated non-null string at the beginning of a line:

/ˆ\(..*\)\1/

The following regular expression will NOT work as intended:

/ˆ\(.*\)\1/

because .* matches any string including the null string, and a null string or
any repeated sequence of null strings will be matched on any line.
