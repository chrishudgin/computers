Case-insensitive matching of a field (GECOS) using a regex and printing the
   entire line (default action) that contains the match:
$ awk -F: 'tolower($5) ~ /hudgin/' /etc/passwd

Remove all duplicate lines from input without sorting.  Duplicate lines are
removed even if they are not adjacent, and the order of the lines is not
changed.
$ awk '! seen[$0]++'

Pass a shell variable to an awk script:
$ MYDIR=/mynfs1
$ awk -v dir="${MYDIR}" '{ print dir }'
