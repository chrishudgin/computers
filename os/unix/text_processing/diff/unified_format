Output diffs in unified format:

$ diff -u <file1> <file2>

Each set of diffs in the output is preceded by a line with the following
format:

@@ -a,b +x,y @@

where
a = starting line in <file1>
b = number of lines affected in <file1> (0 or more)
   b = number of unaltered context lines shown plus number of deleted lines
x = starting line in <file2>
y = number of lines affected in <file2> (0 or more)
   y = number of unaltered context lines shown plus number of added lines

If b or y is 1, it and the comma preceding it may be omitted.
