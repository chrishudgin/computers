Apply diffs to an original file to produce the modified version of the file:

$ patch [-o outputfile] original_file diff_file

Reverse diffs and apply to modified file in order to reconstruct original file
(does not work with diff files in "ed" format due to insufficient information):

$ patch -R [-o outputfile] modified_file diff_file

If the "-o outputfile" argument is omitted, patch will overwrite the original
file with the modified contents.
