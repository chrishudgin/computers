Searches outside the context of a "global" ("g" or "v") command that use
regular expressions begin at the line immediately following the current line .
(dot), not at the current line.

Thus,
1
/test/
searches for "test" starting at the second line of the buffer.

Searches wrap around the end (or beginning) of the file.

To search for the first regular expression match in the buffer starting from
(and including) the first line, use:

0;/<RE>/

where <RE> is the regular expression to search for.

The following do NOT work:

0,/<RE>/    (dot is not changed by the comma separator, so the search for <RE>
             starts at .+1, not 0)

1;/<RE>/    (the search for <RE> begins at .+1, after the semicolon separator
             sets dot to 1--hence the search begins at line 2, not line 1)
