The "BUGS" section of the ed(1) man page in V7 UNIX includes the following
statement:

"Because 0 is an illegal address for a w command, it is not possible to create
an empty file with ed."

However, modern ed implementations are able to write empty files by using an
implicit line address (but not an explicit line address) of 0 for the write
command.  Thus, the following examples will work in modern ed implementations
(but not V7 UNIX's ed) to create a zero-length file:

$ rm -f foo
$ ed
w foo
0

$ rm -f foo
$ ed foo
w
0
