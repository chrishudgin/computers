There is no way to add a line containing only a period in input mode since a
line containing only a period has the special meaning of terminating input, and
the line with the period is thus discarded.  Use the following procedure
instead.

Add a line containing only a period followed by a newline character:

a
x
.
s/x/./

(or choose any other character besides 'x' to be added and then replaced by '.')
