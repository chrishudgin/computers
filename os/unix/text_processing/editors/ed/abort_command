Aborting a command that consists of multiple steps may result in part of the
command already having taken effect on the buffer when the abort occurs; if
this happens, the steps that have taken effect are not rolled back.  For
example, a if a multi-line append is aborted after one or more lines have
already been entered, the appended line(s) will still be present in the buffer.
