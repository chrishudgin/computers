Split a line at a word:

s/word /word\
/

where "word" is the word (or more generally, regular expression) at which to
split the line.  In this example, the current line (.) is the one being split
and the trailing space after "word" is removed.

Join lines:

1,3j

joins lines 1 through 3 into a single line.  Intervening newline characters are
removed.  No whitespace is added.
