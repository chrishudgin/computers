Find differences between two files and apply edits to the first file to make it
match the second:

$ diff -e file1 file2 > edscript
$ (cat edscript && echo w) | ed - file1

Or all at once:

$ (echo "$(diff -e file1 file2)" && echo w) | ed - file1

In a script in which the diff -e output has been pre-generated for later use:

$ diff -e file1 file2  # copy output into here document in script
# file2 can now be deleted, or the script can be composed to run on a
# different machine that has file1 as the starting point for generating file2
$ cat <<'EOF' |
[... list of ed commands generated as output of diff command above ...]
w file2
EOF
ed -s - file1
