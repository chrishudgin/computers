vi supports regular expressions in searches, but some metacharacters like + { }
< > may need to be escaped with a backslash.  When the option "magic" is set,
extended regular expressions are supported.  Details vary by the implementation
of vi.  vim also supports "very magic", requiring regular expressions to be
preceded immediately by the character sequence \v and reducing the need for
the escape character \ to precede regular expression metacharacters.

An action such as y, c, or d may be attached to a search pattern in visual
mode, so that the action will affect all text up to but not including text that
matches the search pattern, or, if a line offset is given after the search
pattern, all text up through the entire line containing text that matches the
search pattern.

Examples:

c/foo   # change from the current position up to but not including foo
d/foo/+0  # delete lines from the current line through the line containing foo
y/foo/-2  # yank lines from the current line through two lines prior to the
          # line containing foo
