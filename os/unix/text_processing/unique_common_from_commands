The comm(1) utility will show lines that are unique to one (sorted) file or
another or duplicated in both, but it requires its inputs to be files, not
command outputs in a pipeline.

To generate lists of lines that are unique to, or common to, the outputs of
two commands, the following syntax can be used:

Show lines common to output of cmd1 and cmd2:
(cmd1 | sort | uniq; cmd2 | sort | uniq) | sort | uniq -d
This generates:
All lines in cmd1; all lines in cmd2; then show only duplicates (lines in cmd1
and cmd2)

Show lines in output of cmd1 but not cmd2:
((cmd1 | sort | uniq ; cmd2 | sort | uniq) | sort | uniq -u; cmd1 | sort | uniq) | sort | uniq -d
This generates:
All lines in cmd1 or cmd2 but not both; all lines in cmd1; then show only
duplicates (lines that are in cmd1 but not cmd2)
