Display escape sequences in a text stream for characters recognized by the C
standard:

NUL                  \0
<alert character>    \a
<backspace>          \b
<form-feed>          \f
<newline>            \n
<carriage return>    \r
<tab>                \t
<vertical tab>       \v

by piping to

hexdump -v -e '"%_c"'

This method has the advantave of not embedding spaces between characters as the
"od -c" command does.

Example:

$ echo -e "ab\tc d\n" | hexdump -v -e '"%_c"' ; echo
ab\tc d\n\n
