From https://mbreen.com/m4.html:
...
In a macro definition, argument references like $1 expand immediately,
regardless of surrounding quotes.
...

For example, in the following m4 session, $1 is expanded immediately when Z
is first expandwd, not when W is expanded later:

$m4
define(`Z',`define(`W',`$1')')

Z(3)

W
3

Immediate expansion of argument variables occurs regardless of how many levels
of quotes surround them:

$m4

define(`Z',`define(`W',``$1'')')

Z(3)

W
3

$m4
define(`Z',`define(`W',```$1''')')

Z(3)

W
`3'

To delay expansion of numbered argument variables, use the following technique
from the mbreen.com link above:
...
Where necessary, this immediate expansion can be prevented by breaking up the
reference with inside quotes, e.g., $`'1.
...

For example, the following m4 session defines Z with delayed expansion of $1,
such that when Z is expanded, it defines W to be W's first argument (not Z's),
and when W is expanded with an argument, it returns the value of W's argument:

$ m4
define(`Z',`define(`W',$`'1)')

Z

W(6)
6
