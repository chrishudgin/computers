diff3 can generate ed command scripts, but some versions of diff3, like that on
macOS 15, cannot properly generate an ed command to create a line with nothing
but . (dot) on it.  This limitation does not apply to the regular "diff"
command on macOS, nor to the GNU diff3 and diff commands in the diffutils
package.
