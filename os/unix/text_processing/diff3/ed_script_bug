diff3 can generate ed command scripts, but some versions of diff3, like the one
included with macOS 15, cannot properly generate an ed command to create a line
with nothing but . (dot) on it.  This limitation does not apply to the regular
"diff" command on macOS, nor to the diff3 and diff commands in the GNU
diffutils package.
