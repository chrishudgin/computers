The standard output format for diff3, when it is run with no options, includes
ed-like addresses and commands (a and c, specifically).  However, the output is
not an ed script.  The meanings of the lines that look like ed commands are as
follows:

filenum:n1a
[different_filenum:n1a]
   For the file number(s) listed, at line n1, an append is needed to make this
   file or these files match the other(s).

filenum:n1[,n2]c
[different_filenum:n1[,n2]c]
   For the file number(s) listed, from line n1 [to line n2], a change is needed
   to make this file or these files match the other(s).

The files are denoted by numbers 1,2,3 corresponding to the order in which the
files appear on the diff3 command line.

For both types of the above modification directives, the ed-like commands are
followed on succeeding lines by the EXISTING content of specified file or
files, NOT the new content that is needed to produce a match for the other
files.
