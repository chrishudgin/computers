The standard output format for diff3, when it is run with no options, includes
ed-like addresses and commands (a and c, specifically).  However, the output is
not an ed script.  The meanings of the lines that look like ed commands are as
follows:

filenum:n1a
   In file number <filenum>, at line n1, an append is needed to make this file
   match the others.

filenum:n1[,n2]c
   In file number <filenum>, from line n1 [to line n2], a change is needed to
   make this file match the others.

For both types of the above modification directives, the ed-like commands are
followed on succeeding lines by the EXISTING content of <filenum>, NOT the new
content that is needed to produce a match for the other files.
