The comma and semicolon characters are both used to separate the first and last
addresses (line numbers) used for a command, yielding an address range on which
the command will operate.  However, comma and semicolon differ in their
operation.  Succinctly, the ; character sets the current line (. or "dot") to
the first address before computing the second address, while the comma operator
does not (leaving the current address unchanged).

This difference becomes important when regular expression searches are used to
set an address, since a forward regular expression search always begins on the
line following the current line, and a backward regular expression search
always begins on the line preceding the current line.
