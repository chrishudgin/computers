Show line numbers and corresponding lines:

In classic ed (e.g. from Version 7 UNIX) and modern ed:

g/^/.=p

This command shows each line number followed by a newline and then the text of
that line.

In modern ed only:

%n

This command shows the line number and the line text separated by a tab rather
than by a newline.
