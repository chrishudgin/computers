Notes on the paper "Advanced Editing on UNIX" by Brian W. Kernighan

*****

Section 2, Special Characters

Under heading "Rearranging a Line with \( ... \)" :

A global command to print lines before and after changes given by the
substitution command

1,$s/ˆ\([ˆ,]∗\), ∗\(.∗\)/\2 \1/

would be:

g/^\([^,]*\), *\(.*\)/p\
s//\2 \1/p

or to print just the changed lines after they have been changed:

g/^\([^,]*\), *\(.*\)/s//\2 \1/p

*****

Section 6, Cut and Paste with the Editor

Under heading "The Temporary Escape '!'" :

The example given of starting another ed session using the shell escape
mechanism also illustrates when the "f" command to show the current filename is
useful--to help distinguish one editing session from another when they are
nested.
