In the version of ed in Version 7 UNIX, the numeric value of . (dot) is
decremented by one after performing a null (empty) insert "i" or change "c"
operation.  In modern versions of ed, the numeric value of . (dot) is unchanged
if a null line is inserted or an existing line is replaced via the "c" command
by an empty (null) line.

As a consequence of the Version 7 UNIX ed behavior, the following command
sequences set the value of . (dot) to the invalid line number of 0:

Inserting no line before line 1:

1i
.
.=
0

Changing line 1 in such a way as to delete it:
1c
.
.=
0

In modern versions of ed, these command sequences result in the value of .
(dot) being set to 1, not 0.
