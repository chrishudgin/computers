In the version of ed in Version 7 UNIX, the numeric value of . (dot) is
decremented by one after performing a null (empty) insert "i" or change "c"
operation.  In modern versions of ed, the numeric value of . (dot) is unchanged
if a null line is inserted or an existing line is replaced via the "c" command
by an empty (null) line, unless there are no lines left in the buffer, in which
case . (dot) is set to 0.

Example of removing last remaining line in buffer:

$ rm -f newfile
$ ed newfile
a
first line
.
1c
.
.=
0

In Version 7 UNIX, the following command ed sequences set the value of . (dot)
to 0:

Inserting no line before line 1:

1i
.
.=
0

Changing line 1 in such a way as to delete it:
1c
.
.=
0

In modern versions of ed, the latter two command sequences shown above result
in the value of . (dot) being set to 1, not 0.
