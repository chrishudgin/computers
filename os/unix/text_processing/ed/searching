Searches using regular expressions begin at the line immediately following the
current line . (dot), not at the current line.

Searches wrap around the end (or beginning) of the file.

To search for a regular expression starting from (and including) the first line
in the buffer, use:

0;/<RE>/

where <RE> is the regular expression to search for.

The following do NOT work:

0,/<RE>/    (dot is not changed by the comma separator, so the search for <RE>
             starts at .+1, not 0)

1;/<RE>/    (the search for <RE> begins at .+1, after the semicolon separator
             sets dot to 1--hence the search begins at line 2, not line 1)
