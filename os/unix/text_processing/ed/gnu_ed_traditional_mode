These are the differences between GNU ed's behavior in traditional mode (-G or
--traditional) and default mode:

In traditional mode, newline (a '\n' character) as the command to run in a
global command ("g" or "v") is the equivalent to a ".+1p" command, as it is in
a non-global context.  In default mode, newline (a '\n' character) as the
command to run in a global command ("g" or "v") is the equivalent of a ".p"
command.

In traditional mode, if there is no current filename, the "f" command with no
parameters will return a null filename and not generate an error.  In default
mode, if there is no current filename, the "f" command with no parameters will
not return a value but will generate an error.

In traditional mode, there is no default destination address for the m and t
commands; leaving off the destination address does not move or copy lines but
does generate an error.  In default mode, the default address for the "m" and
"t" commands is . (dot), meaning moved/copied lines will be placed immediately
after the line . (dot).

In traditional mode, the "l" command does not print a "$" character to denote
the end of a line.  In default mode, it does.

In traditional mode, !! will generate an error if the previous ! was run
without a shell command following it.  In default mode, !! following a ! with
no shell command to run will run a null command and not generate an error.
