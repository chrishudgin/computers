When ed is opened on a new (empty) file, or the last remaining line in the
buffer is removed, the numeric value of . (dot) is set to 0.

In the version of ed in Version 7 UNIX, the numeric value of . (dot) is
decremented by one after performing a null (empty) insert "i" or change "c"
operation.  This can in some cases result in the value of . (dot) being set to
0 (see below for examples).  In modern versions of ed, the numeric value of .
(dot) is unchanged if a null line is inserted or an existing line is replaced
via the "c" command by an empty (null) line, unless there are then no lines
left in the buffer, in which case . (dot) is set to 0.

Example of removing last remaining line in buffer:

$ rm -f newfile
$ ed newfile
.=
0
a
first line
.
.=
1
1c
.
.=
0

In Version 7 UNIX, the following command ed sequences set the value of . (dot)
to 0:

Inserting no line before line 1:

1i
.
.=
0

Changing line 1 in such a way as to delete it:
1c
.
.=
0

In modern versions of ed, the latter two command sequences shown above result
in the value of . (dot) being set to 1, not 0.
