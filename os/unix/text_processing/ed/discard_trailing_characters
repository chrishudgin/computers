Early versions of ed, such as the version found in Version 7 UNIX, would ignore
any characters following the last newline character when opening a file.  That
is, ed would not read those trailing characters into the buffer.

Modern version of ed will automatically append a newline to such trailing text
and print a diagnostic message, "newline appended".
