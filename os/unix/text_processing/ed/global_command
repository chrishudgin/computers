The "global" command "<addr1>,<addr2>g/<RE>/<command>" operates as a "foreach",
running <command> iteratively on each line selected by the combination of the
specified address range <addr1,addr2> and regular expression <RE> matches
within that range.

In contrast, commands line "t" (copy) and "m" (move) operate on a range of
lines as a block, not iteratively on one line at a time.
