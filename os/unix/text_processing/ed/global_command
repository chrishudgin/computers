The "global" command "<addr1>,<addr2>g/<RE>/<command>" operates as a "foreach",
running <command> iteratively on each line selected by the regular expression
<RE> matches within the specified address range <addr1,addr2>.

In contrast, commands line "t" (copy) and "m" (move) operate on a range of
lines as a block, not iteratively on one line at a time.

A "command" executed in a global context can include an address range (and even
regular expressions that evaluate to addresses), just as a command outside of a
global context can.  Thus, the following syntax is valid:

g/<RE>/[<addr1>[,<addr2>]]<command>

Example:

g/^foo/+,/^bar/-p

prints all lines strictly between those that begin with foo and those that
begin with bar.
