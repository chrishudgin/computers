GNU grep's color capability can cause the final character in an output line to
be erased from the terminal display if the previous character on the line
matched the search pattern and was therefore colorized.

A workaround to prevent grep from clearing the terminal output to the end of
the line is to set the following environment variable:

export GREP_COLORS=ne
