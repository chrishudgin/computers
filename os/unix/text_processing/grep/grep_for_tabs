There are at least four ways to grep for literal tab characters in a regular
expression:

Use the terminal's "lnext" character (as shown by stty -a), typically ^V (i.e.
Ctrl-V) for "verbatim", to indicate that the next character will be treated
literally rather than interpreted, and then type the tab key:

$ grep '<Ctrl-V><tab>'  # where <Ctrl-V> and <tab> are keystrokes, not text

On systems with a version of grep (such as GNU grep) that supports Perl regular
expression syntax, use the character sequence \t to indicate a tab:

$ grep -P '\t'

Use the shell's printf function (if it has one) to print a tab character:

$ grep "$(printf '\t')"

In bash, use the ANSI-C quoting feature:

$ grep $'\t' foo.txt
