There are at least two ways to grep for literal tab characters in a regular
expression:

Use the terminal's "lnext" character (as shown by stty -a), typically ^V (i.e.
Ctrl-V), to indicate that the next character will be treated literally rather
than interpreted, and then type the tab key:

$ grep '<Ctrl-V><tab>'  # where <Ctrl-V> and <tab> are keystrokes, not text

Alternatively, on systems with a version of grep (such as GNU grep) that
supports Perl regular expression syntax, use the character sequence \t to
indicate a tab:

$ grep -P '\t'
