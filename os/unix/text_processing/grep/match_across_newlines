Match a string, such as multiple words, that may extend across a line boundary:

$ cat mytext
123
abc
def
ghi
rfhabc
defqui
ptty

$ grep -Eowz "abc[[:space:]]*def" mytext | tr '\0' '\n'
abc
def

When given ordinary newline-separated text input, this method requires the -o
option (print only matching text, not entire lines with matching text) since
with the -z option to grep needed to override the usual treatment of newlines,
the null character (\0) is being used instead of newline (\n) as the input
record separator and "lines" are thus not treated as recognized entities (or to
put it another way, the entire input is treated as one "line").
