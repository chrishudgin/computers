To allow an application to access the keyboard directly (as is needed by
the KVM Java app on Dell iDRAC):

System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility

Unlock the padlock and place a check mark beside the application that needs
   direct access to the keyboard or other user input devices
