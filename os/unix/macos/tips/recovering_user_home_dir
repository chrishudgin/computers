After recovering an entire user home directory from a Time Machine backup, it
may be necessary to move the user's ~/Library/Caches directory out of the way
before the user can log in successfully again.

Permissions on the user's Mail folders (/Library/Mail/V5) may also need to be
reset before Mail import will succeed.
