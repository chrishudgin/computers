Use a PL2303 USB to serial cable to connect to a remote server's console port:

screen /dev/tty.usbserial 9600

Ctrl-A Ctrl-\ to kill the screen session

Note: Do not use /dev/cu.usbserial as the device, or else a later screen
session to it will hang the screen process and it will not be possible to kill
it without a reboot.
