Enable Internet Sharing by ensuring that the private subnet's interface is
turned OFF in Network preferences and then enabling Internet Sharing in the
Sharing preferences.

The IPv4 network used for the private subnet's interface is 192.168.2.0/24, and
the IP address of the Mac on that subnet is 192.168.2.1.  Configure other
clients on the subnet to use 192.168.2.1 as their gateway and DNS server.

Network Preferences will continue to show the private subnet's interface in
an "Off" state, but ifconfig will show the private IP assigned to the bridge.
