NFS shares are contained in /etc/exports

To allow mounting below the directory of the share, use the -alldirs option
to the mount in /etc/exports, as in:
/Volumes/apollo\ Users/chudgin  -rw -maproot=root -alldirs

As of macOS 10.13 High Sierra, files on a filesystem with "Ignore ownership on
this volume" set and mounted by an NFS client from a macOS server will appear
to be owned by whichever user is logged in on the client, except that root on
the client will see files appear to be owned by the "nobody" user.

To enable, start, stop, restart NFS server:
nfsd enable; nfsd start; nfsd stop; nfsd restart

To mount an NFSv3 filesystem shared by a RHEL server:
mount -t nfs -o resvport server:/mnt /mnt

To configure NFS mounts on a macOS client to prefer NFS version 4 instead of
the default preference for NFS version 3, place the following line in
/etc/nfs.conf:
nfs.client.mount.options = vers=4
It may be necessary to add the option nolocallocks as well

To automount an NFS filesystem shared by a Linux server, the flag
   "insecure" must be set for the export in /etc/exports on the Linux server

RHEL 7 notes:

# systemctl enable rpcbind
# systemctl enable nfs

NFS shares are contained in /etc/exports

RHEL 7 firewalld must have ports opened:
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service rpc-bind
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service mountd
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service nfs

In order for lockd on RHEL 7 to work from a macOS client, the lockd ports
must be fixed instead of being randomly selected, and netfilter rules must be
created for the fixed port numbers.  The NFS-HOWTO uses port 32768 for lockd TCP
and UDP.  To fix these ports for use by lockd, edit /etc/sysctl.conf to add
the following lines:

fs.nfs.nlm_tcpport = 32768
fs.nfs.nlm_udpport = 32768

and then set netfilter rules:

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port 32768/tcp
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port 32768/udp

Reboot for the changes to take effect.
