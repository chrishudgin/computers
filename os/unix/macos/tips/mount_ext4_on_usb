MacOS does not support mounting ext4 filesystems, but it is possible to mount
them through VirtualBox in a Linux VM.  This procedure is verified to work
on RHEL 7 and Ubuntu 16 virtual machines in VirtualBox 5.1.10 on MacOS 10.12.1.

Insert the USB device that contains an ext4 filesystem (which may be on a
   partition).
To see which disk name the USB device was given by MacOS, run:
   # diskutil list
If any non-ext4 filesystems on the USB device mount automatically in MacOS,
   unmount them using the Finder or "diskutil unmount diskYsZ"
Start the Linux VM.
Once the VM is fully up, select Devices -> USB -> [Your device] in the VM's
   VirtualBox console window menu.  This will make the device available to
   the VM.
Run "fdisk -l" in the VM to see the USB device.  You can now mount it as
   with any other block device.

When you are done using the filesystem, unmount it in the VM.
Eject the device in the VM:  # eject sdX
Unselect the USB device from the VM's VirtualBox console window menu:
   Devices -> USB -> [Uncheck your device]
Shut down the VM if it is not needed for any other purpose.
Eject the USB device from MacOS:  # eject diskY
Physically remove the USB device.
