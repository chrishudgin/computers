If an attempt to shut down or reboot using GUI controls (Apple menu -> Restart
or Shut Down) after starting the installation of a security update leads to a
black screen with a mouse cursor on it and no further progress made in shutting
down:

Log in using ssh.
$ sudo -i
# rm -rf /var/folders/zz/zy*
# shutdown -r now

Then apply the security update again.
