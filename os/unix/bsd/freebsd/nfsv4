By default, FreeBSD attempts to mount an NFS filesystem using protocol version
3, then protocol version 2.  Writes to a Linux-exported NFS filesystem from
FreeBSD can be very slow when NFS version 3 is being used.

To force FreeBSD to attempt to use protocol version 4, add the mount option
nfsv4.

Confirm that a filesystem is mounted using NFSv4 by checking for the nfsv4acls
mount option in the output of the "mount" command (run without flags or
arguments).
