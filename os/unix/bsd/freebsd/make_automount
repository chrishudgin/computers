When the make command is run on a Makefile that is automounted on an NFS
filesystem, the following error can occur:

Nov  3 12:40:34 fbsd12vm1 automountd[827]: "/etc/autofs/special_hosts share", pi
d 828, terminated with exit status 1
Nov  3 12:40:34 fbsd12vm1 automountd[827]: failed to handle special map "-hosts"
Nov  3 12:40:34 fbsd12vm1 kernel: WARNING: autofs_trigger_one: request for /net/
 completed with error 5

Each time make is run, this error will delay its completion by a few seconds.

This error occurs because make is designed to attempt to access the directory
/net/share/mk through the automounter, which assumes that there is a host named
"share" that is exporting a directory called "mk".

To disable this behavior, set the following environment variable:

MAKESYSPATH=/usr/share/mk
