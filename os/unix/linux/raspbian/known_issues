ltrace is broken on Linux ARM as of Raspbian image current in April 2017.
This is still true in the current Raspberry Pi OS image on December 14, 2023.

rustc segfaults when running on a Raspberry Pi model prior to 4 with a 64-bit
kernel.  Last checked December 14, 2023.

The light-locker package does not add an entry to the main menu editor for
   screen locking, but the lxlock package does.
   Alternatively, use "dm-tool lock" from the command line.
