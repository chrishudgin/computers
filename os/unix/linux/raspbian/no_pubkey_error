When running "apt-get update", the following error may occur for backports
repositories whose public keys have changed:

W: GPG error: http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 04EE7237B7D453EC NO_PUBKEY 648ACFD622F3D138

The public keys are identified by the hexadecimal strings following the text
"NO_PUBKEY".  In this example, they are 04EE7237B7D453EC and 648ACFD622F3D138.

To add the new public keys to the apt keychain, run the following commands for
each key to be added, substituting the actual value of the missing key:

# gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 04EE7237B7D453EC
# gpg -a --export 04EE7237B7D453EC | apt-key add -

Repeat the commands for each missing key:

# gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 648ACFD622F3D138
# gpg -a --export 648ACFD622F3D138 | apt-key add -

The Ubuntu keyserver is appropriate to use even with Raspbian.

Once this is done, apt-get commands should work again.
