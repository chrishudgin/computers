The CentOS ARM port may not activate a newly installed kernel automatically
even after one or more reboots.

To activate the new kernel if it did not activate automatically, reinstall it
with "yum reinstall <pkgname>", e.g.

# yum reinstall raspberrypi2-kernel-4.14.101-v7.1.el7.armv7hl

and then reboot.

*****

As of the CentOS 7 RPi2 packages dated 11/20/2016 and earlier, there is a
memory leak in irqbalance.  The effects of the leak can be mitigated by
bouncing irqbalance once per day:
# cat > /etc/cron.daily/irqbalance <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
/bin/systemctl restart irqbalance.service
EOF
# chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/irqbalance
Or by disabling it:
# systemctl stop irqbalance; systemctl disable irqbalance
