The user account used by Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) to log into managed
systems must be able to sudo to a privileged account (e.g. root), but it does
not need to be configured with the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file since
AAP can enter a configured password for the account when using sudo to obtain
privileged account status.
