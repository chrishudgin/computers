Register a server with a new subscription if it was previously registered with
an expired one:

# subscription-manager remove --all
# subscription-manager unregister
# subscription-manager clean
# subscription-manager register
# subscription-manager refresh
# subscription-manager attach --auto

*****

To register a server with a Red Hat developer subscription:

RHEL 7:
# subscription-manager register
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<PoolID>
# systemctl restart rhsmcertd

RHEL 6:
# subscription-manager register
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<PoolID>
# service rhsmcertd restart 

To list available subscriptions (those that match the physical/virtual server
type and are not already in use by the given host):

# subscription-manager list --available
Output will include a Pool ID.

To attach to a particular subscription (pool):

# subscription-manager attach --pool=<PoolID>
