PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

yum is a symlink to dnf ("Dandified Yum").

There are two repos installed by default:

baseos
appstream

AppStream supports the installation of any (but not more than one at a time) of
multiple versions of a package through "modules" versioned by "streams" which
are recognized with the new dnf/yum keyword "module", as in:

# dnf module list|info|install|... [module-name[:stream-version]]

A list of available streams for a module is shown in the output of
# dnf module list <module-name>

Each module has one or more installation profiles (sets of packages to
install), including a default profile.

Show module profiles:
# dnf module info --profile <module-name>

When installing a module, the notation "@module-name[:stream-version]" can be
used which eliminates the need for using the keyword "module", as in:

# dnf install @python27:2.7

which is equivalent to:

# dnf module install python27:2.7

To switch to a different stream version of a module, simply use "dnf module
install" to install the desired stream version and then run:
# yum distro-sync
to ensure that packages that depend on the newly installed stream version are
(re)installed at the correct version as well.

*****

PYTHON VERSIONING

By default, a feature-limited python3 is available as
/usr/libexec/platform-python, intended for use by system tools like dnf but not
general purpose applications.

The full python3 and/or python2 can be installed through their respective
package aliases python3 and python2.

If python2 is installed, it is available as /usr/bin/python2.
If python3 is installed, it is available as /usr/bin/python3.

There is no /usr/bin/python unless a symlink is created for it using the "alternatives" system:

# alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3
OR
# alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python2

*****

STORAGE

New storage pool management system called Stratis, similar in concept to ZFS.
Stratis is provided by the packages stratis-cli and stratisd.
"Rolling back" a Stratis snapshot involves creating a new snapshot filesystem from the first snapshot.

Bootable LVM snapshots using boom (provided by boom-boot package)

XFS reflinks for file copies are copy-on-write to minimize space used and time
required for file copies.  Reflinks are not created automatically as they would
be in ZFS; they must be created with the --reflink option to the cp command.

*****

NETWORKING

nftables (nft command) replaces iptables.

nftables can create nonlinear lookup tables.

List all tables:
# nft list tables

Show inet (IPv4/IPv6) rules generated by firewalld:
# nft list table inet firewalld

*****

CONTAINERS

RHEL 8 provides tools for managing containers without the need for Docker:
podman, builah, skopeo, runc.  These can be installed with:
# yum module install container-tools
