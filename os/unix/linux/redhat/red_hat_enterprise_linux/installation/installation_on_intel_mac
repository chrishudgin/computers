Install RHEL 8 or 9 on an Intel Mac:

An EFI system partition on an Intel Mac does not need to be formatted as HFS+.
A normal VFAT-formatted EFI system partition will work.

Insert RHEL installer thumb drive.
Hold down Option or Alt key while booting.
Select "EFI Boot" to boot to RHEL installer thumb drive.
Choose the menu option to install RHEL.

In the disk selection screen, select the desired installation disk.
Select Custom Storage Configuration.

At the bottom of the screen click on "Full disk summary and boot loader".
Select the button "Do not install boot loader", then Close.
Ignore the warning thet the system may not be bootable.

In a text console window, ensure that the target installation disk is
partitioned as GPT with no partitions.

In the Manual Partitioning screen, create a 1 GB VFAT partition with a mount
point of /a.  After the installation is complete, it will be converted
manually to the EFI system partition.  Do not attempt to create a
/boot/efi filesystem in the installer.

After starting the installation, ignore the warning about the missing
mactel-boot package.

After the installation is complete, boot to the installer thumb drive,
select Troubleshooting, and boot to rescue mode.  Choose the option to
mount the installed Linux filesystems at /mnt/sysroot.

Make sure all filesystems are mounted.

At the shell prompt:
# chroot /mnt/sysroot
# umount /a
# cd /boot/efi
# tar -cvf /tmp/efi.tar .
# rm -rf EFI
# blkid

Create an entry for the new /boot/efi filesystem in /etc/fstab using the UUID
idenfified by blkid:

UUID=XXXX-XXXX /boot/efi vfat umask=0077,shortname=winnt 0 2

Use gdisk to set the type of the /boot/efi partition to ef00 and its name to
"EFI System Partition"

# chmod 755 /boot/efi
# mount /boot/efi
# cd /boot/efi
# tar xvf /tmp/efi.tar
# rm /tmp/efi.tar
# cd
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
Ignore any warnings about not being able to find a GRUB drive for the
thumb drive device.

# exit
# exit

The system should now reboot, relabel SELinux contexts, and reboot again.
