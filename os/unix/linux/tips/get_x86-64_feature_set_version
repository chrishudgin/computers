Some x86-64 operating systems (such as RHEL 9) require CPU feature sets beyond
the base level, such as v2.

The version of an x86-64 CPU's feature set (v2, v3, v4, etc.) can be determined
with the following command installed with the glibc.x86_64 package:

$ /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help

Example:

$ /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep x86-64-v
  x86-64-v4
  x86-64-v3
  x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)

In this example, the CPU supports only the x86-64 v2 feature set fully.  The
CPU may or may not partially support the v3 and v4 feature sets.
