One way to sort a directory tree (not just a single directory) of files by
their last modification date is to use GNU find, as in the following example:

$ find . -type f -printf "%T@ %Tc %p\n" | sort -n | sed 's/^[^ ]* //'

The examples above sort files by least recent to most recent.

To sort files most recent first, add the "-r" option to the sort command.
