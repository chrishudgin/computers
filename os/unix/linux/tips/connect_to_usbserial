Set up and use a USB-to-serial cable attached to a remote system's serial port:

Physically connect the cable on both ends.  The driver modules (e.g. pl2303 and
usbserial) should autoload into the kernel on the Linux system connected to the
USB end of the cable.

Add the user to the dialout group:
# usermod -aG dialout chudgin

Connect:
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600
('Ctrl-A k' to kill session)
