Configure KVM for Red Hat

Reference: Virtualization Deployment and Administration Guide for RHEL 7:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/index

RHEV (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization) is a stripped down RHEL hypervisor
intended for dedicated use as such.

RHEV-M (RHEV Manager) provides administrative tools for KVM VMs across multiple
RHEV hypervisor hosts, allowing centralized management, VM migration, etc.

59:

Installing the packages required for creating and running KVM virtual machines
can be done in the GUI:

Application -> System Tools -> Software

or on the command line:

# yum groups install "Virtualization Host" "Virtualization Client"

During installation with anaconda, Red Hat recommends selecting
"Virtualization Host" with the "Virtualization Platform" add-on.

61:

The Details menu that leads to the Virtual Networks tab is available by
right-clicking on the words "QEMU/KVM" below the row of icons in virt-manager.

It is also possible to connect to a remote hypervisor through the virt-manager
GUI, which uses ssh to do so, or the "virsh connect" command with a
qemu:///host resource identifier.

Configure a Virtual machine on KVM

75:

Manual edits to configuration files in /etc/libvirt take effect after libvirtd
is restarted, as with
#  systemctl restart libvirtd
or use
# virsh edit <domain> : edit XML config for domain; takes effect at next domain
   restart

Restarting libvirtd does not shut down running virtual machines.

76:

virsh refers to guest VMs as "domains"

Useful virsh commands include:
autostart
create (define + start)
define (from an XML file)
destroy
edit
reboot
shutdown
start

# virsh destroy <domain> : forcibly shuts down a running VM; does not remove its
  disk image file or configuration

# virsh undefine <domain> --remove-all-storage : delete VM config for domain and
  remove its disk image file

# virt-install
   --name=tester1.example.com
   --memory=1024
   --vcpus=2
   --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/tester1.example.com.img,size=16
   --network network=outsider (KVM network name if not using "default")
   --location ftp://192.168.122.1/pub/inst
   or
   --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-dvd.iso

77:

To use a Kickstart profile for automated installation, add, e.g.
   -x "ks=file:/my.ks"
   or
   -x "ks=ftp://server1.example.com/pub/my.ks"
   -x "ks=http://server1.example.com/my.ks"

78:

# virsh list --all : show all configured VMs, whether or not they are running

# virsh autostart [--disable] <domain> : set or unset autostart for a domain
   (controls whether the domain boots when the host boots)
   (creates or removes symlink to domain XML file from
    /etc/libvirt/qemu/autostart)

# virsh dominfo <domain> : show domain info, including autostart flag

# virsh {start|shutdown|destroy} <domain> : start, gracefully shut down,
  or forcibly shut down domain

80:

Shut down source domain before cloning it with virt-clone.

# virt-clone
   --original=<source domain>
   --name=<target domain>
   --file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/<target domain>.img
   --file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/<target domain>-1.img
   --file=/var/lib/libvirt/images/<target domain>-2.img

By default, virt-clone will assign a new, random MAC address to a clone VM.

However, the hostname and IP address within the clone OS will still be
identical to those within the source domain and should be changed manually in a
rescue boot of the clone (manually append "rescue" to the kernel command line
from the GRUB edit prompt).

*****

All Kickstart directives are documented in:
/usr/share/doc/pykickstart-*/kickstart-docs.rst
(installed by the pykickstart package)

81:

The Kickstart configuration file automatically created during installation,
/root/anaconda-ks.cfg, does not include settings for post-installation tasks
like registering with subscription-manager.  Post-installation task settings
are recorded in /root/initial-setup-ks.cfg.

To facilitate automation by bypassing the Firstboot initial setup screen,
set the following directive in the Kickstart configuration file:

firstboot --disabled

82:

When booted to install media, a location for a Kickstart configuration file can
be appended to the kernel command line by pressing Tab while the "Install"
option is highlighted in the installer text menu.

Syntax for specifying the location of a Kickstart configuration file on the
installer's kernel command line is:

ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg
ks=hd:sdb1:/ks.cfg
ks=hd:fd0:/ks.cfg
ks=ftp://192.168.122.1/pub/ks.cfg
ks=http://192.168.122.1/ks.cfg
ks=nfs:192.168.122.1:/ks.cfg

If the Kickstart configuration file is placed on an anonymous FTP server, it
should be world-readable and have the correct SELinux context for a file in
its directory.

85:

Syntax for specifying the location of installation media within a Kickstart
configuration file is:

cdrom
harddrive --partition=/dev/sda10 --dir=/tmp/inst
url --url http://192.168.122.1/inst
url --url ftp://192.168.122.1/pub/inst
nfs --server=192.168.122.1 --dir=/inst

88:

The default action at the end of a Kickstart installation is "halt", which
prompts the user before rebooting the system.  The following actions can
be added to a Kickstart configuration file:

halt (prompt, then reboot)
shutdown (shut down without prompting)
poweroff (same as shutdown)
reboot [--eject] (reboot without prompting, optionally ejecting CD/DVD first)

The desired action directive should be added just *before* the %packages
section of the Kickstart configuration file.

Packages to install or exclude can be specified with:
%packages
@^envgroupname (environment group, i.e. a group of groups)
@groupname
packagename
-packagename (exclude package unless it is mandatory for a group or required
   by another package's dependencies)
%end

Packages in a group that are marked mandatory or default are installed as part
of that group.  Packages that are marked optional are not unless they are
required to satisfy dependencies.

Optional pre-installation (pre-partitioning) actions can be specified with:
%pre
...
%end

Optional post-installation actions can be specified with:
%post
...
%end

Verify the syntax of a Kickstart configuration file:
# ksvalidator /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
(not required, but recommended)

90:

The Kickstart Configurator is installed with:
# yum install system-config-kickstart

Kickstart Configurator does not support the creation of LVM logical volumes
or allow individual packages to be selected for installation.

92:

Kickstart can install ("install") or upgrade an existing installation
("upgrade").
