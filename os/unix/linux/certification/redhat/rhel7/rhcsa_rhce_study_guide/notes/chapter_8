Limit root login access on consoles by commenting out entries in /etc/securetty

415:

Using sudo's "Runas" capability:

$ sudo -u testuser some command with args
$ sudo -g testgroup some command with args

List sudo privileges available to current user:
$ sudo -l

413:

Per-user (or per-group) login access can be allowed or disallowed by location
(local tty or network address) using /etc/security/access.conf
All entries in access.conf are commented out by default, imposing no login
restrictions by location.

Note: The PAM login module by default does not perform any checks using the PAM
access module.  To configure PAM login to use the PAM access module, add the
following line to /etc/pam.d/login :
auth required pam_access.so

423:

Note:  The easiest way to install the directory client packages is with:
# yum groups install "Directory Client"
# yum install pam_krb5 krb5_workstation authconfig-gtk
and if needed for Windows authenticaiton:
# yum install samba-winbind

Red Hat recommends:
# yum install authconfig-gtk sssd krb5-workstation
and if needed for IPA or Windows authenticaiton:
# yum install ipa-client samba-winbind realmd

To configure an LDAP client on the command line:

Install the packages:
openldap-clients
nss-pam-ldapd

Edit the following directives in /etc/nslcd.conf:

uri (e.g. ldap://192.168.0.1 or ldaps://192.168.0.1 for SSL)
base (e.g. dc=example,dc=com)
ssl (yes, no, or start_tls)
tls_cacertdir /etc/openldap/cacerts

Edit the following directives in /etc/openldap/ldap.conf to match what was
set in /etc/nslcd.conf:

BASE
URI
TLS_CACERTDIR

Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to add "ldap" to the hosts, passwd, shadow, and groups
services:

hosts: files ldap dns
passwd: files ldap
shadow: files ldap
group: files ldap

Enable and start the nslcd service with systemctl:
# systemctl enable nslcd
# systemctl start nslcd

An LDAP server listens on the following ports:
389 (LDAP)
636 (LDAP over SSL)

425:

SSSD (System Security Service Daemon) provides caching for offline
authentication when the designated LDAP server is temporarily unavailable.  It
can be used instead of nslcd for this purpose.

Unlike nslcd, sssd can also (in additon to LDAP authentication) handle
authentication to Active Directory, Kerberos, and IPA (Identity, Policy, and
Audit server).

Install the package sssd, which adds many dependencies.

By default, there is no /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file, but authconfig-* will create
it.

Example /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:

id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
chpass_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://127.0.0.1
ldap_id_use_start_tls = True
ldap_tls_cacertdir = /etc/openldap/cacerts
[sssd]
services = nss, pam
config_file_version = 1
domains = default

When using sssd, entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf should be as follows:
passwd: files sss
shadow: files sss
group: files sss

Enable and start the sssd service:
# systemctl enable sssd
# systemctl start sssd

Install the package pam_krb5 if Kerberos authentication is needed.

426:

A much easier method to configure remote user authentication is with
authconfig-tui or authconfig-gtk.

430:

To install the IPA client:
# yum install ipa-client

432:

The recommended way to create a shared directory for a group to use is to
create the group (with a GID > 60000), create a directory /home/<groupname>
owned by nobody:<groupname> mode 2770, and add desired users to the group.
