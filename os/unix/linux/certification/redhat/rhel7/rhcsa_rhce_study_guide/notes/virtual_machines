There are two NAT-ed KVM networks used in the book:
192.168.122.0/24 (created automatically by libvirt software installation
   on the physical host and named "default")
192.168.100.0/24 (created in Exercise 2-1 on the same physical host
    and named "outsider"), DHCP range 192.168.100.128 through 192.168.100.254,
    DNS domain name example.org
Both of these networks will use the built-in KVM DHCP server, dnsmasq

VM gateways on physical host:
192.168.122.1 maui.example.com maui
192.168.100.1 (no hostname given in book)

System roles and IPs for virtual machines are listed in Table 1-2
192.168.122.50 server1.example.com server1
192.168.122.150 tester1.example.com tester1
192.168.100.100 outsider1.example.org outsider1
Plus:
192.168.100.50 clone1.example.org clone1

All four VMs are configured in the labs for chapter 2.
