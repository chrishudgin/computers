Lab 27.2:

"Use sar to show swapping statistics for processes that have been running
yesterday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m."

If "yesterday" was the 18th of the month, one way to do this with a default
HISTORY value of 28 in /etc/sysconfig/sysstat is the following:

$ LANG=C sar -S -f /var/log/sa/sa18 -s 11:00:00 -e 14:00:00

or if HISTORY has been set to a value greater than 28, like 366 for a full
year including leap day, and "yesterday" was May 18, 2020:

$ LANG=C sar -S -f /var/log/sa/202005/sa18 -s 11:00:00 -e 14:00:00
