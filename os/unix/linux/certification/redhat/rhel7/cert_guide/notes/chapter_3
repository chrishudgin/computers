mount (without any options) parses the information provided in /proc/mounts

To recursively copy all files and directories within a directory to another
directory while preserving all permissions and attributes,  use:
cp -a /sourcedir/. /targetdir
The trailing /. in the source specification ensures that a subdirectory
named "sourcedir" is not created in /targetdir, only its contents.

This technique is useful when copying all files recursively from a DVD image
into an installation repo directory.

ls -R : recursion does not imply -a; to show hidden files, too, use -aR

rm -rf /symlink_to_dir only removes the symlink, not the dir.
rm -rf /symlink_to_dir/ removes only the dir, not the symlink.

tar -r : append to existing tar file
tar -u : update with newer (more recently modified) files
