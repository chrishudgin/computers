"Do I Know This Already?" Quiz

8. The correct name of the parameter is "ServerAliveInterval".

Configuring SSH Tunnels

Tunnels can be configured to pass traffic from the local system through a
jump server to a remote system (-L) or in the opposite direction (-R).

Throughout this section, the direction stated for the forwarding is backward.

The local forwarding example:

ssh -fNL 5555:localhost:80 root@server2.example.com

forwards port 5555 on the originating host to port 80 on server2 (which is the
localhost after the connection is made).  It does NOT forward port 80 on
server2 to port 5555 on the originating host as stated in the text.

The remote forwarding example:

ssh -fNR 80:localhost:8088 root@lab.sandervanvugt.nl

forwards port 80 on the remote host (lab.sandervanvugt.nl) to the originating
machine, and thence to localhost (which is also the originating machine) port
8088.  It does NOT forward remote port 8088 to local port 80 as stated in the
text.

The direction of forwarding in all three examples in Table 39.3 is stated
incorrectly as well.

Review Questions

7. The command in the answer should be:
ssh -fNR 8088:localhost:80 user@server.somewhere.com

10. "GatewayPorts Yes" needs to be set only if a bind address is set to a value
other than the default (which binds to the remote server's loopback interface
only).  Without "GatewayPorts Yes" being set, the "ssh -fNR <bind_addr>:...."
command will still run and forward traffic but will ignore the <bind_addr>
given and bind only to the loopback interface (the default).

Lab 39.1

1.

On server1:

In /etc/ssh/sshd_config, add (for example) the following lines:

ClientAliveInterval 60
ClientAliveCountMax 60
AllowUsers lisa
Port 2022

# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2022
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2022/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload
# systemctl restart sshd

On server2:

# ssh -p 2022 lisa@server1.example.com

2.

On server1:

# ssh -fNL 3333:localhost:80 root@server2.example.com
