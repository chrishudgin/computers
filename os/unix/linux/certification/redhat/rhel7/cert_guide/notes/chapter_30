Configuring Aggregated Network Interfaces

The phrase "network bonding happened completely in user space" should read
"network bonding happened completely in kernel space".

Understanding IPv6 Addresses

Link-local addresses do not necessarily include the interface MAC address.
Other algorithms, such as with random number generators, can also be used to
generate the interface portion of the IPv6 address (that is, the portion to the
right of the prefix).

The example link-local address should be (after correcting typos and flipping
the 7th bit of the MAC address from the left per the actual algorithm):
fe80::c:29ff:fe04:714a/64

Managing IPv6 Address Configurations

SLAAC addresses do not necessarily include the interface MAC address.  Other
algorithms, such as with random number generators, can also be used to generate
the interface portion of the IPv6 address (that is, the portion to the right of
the prefix).

"ip route show" shows only IPv4 routes by default, not IPv6 routes.

"ip -6 router show" should be "ip -6 route show".

"ping6 ff02::%eth0" should be "ping6 ff02::1%eth0".
