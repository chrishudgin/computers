Understanding the MBR Partitioning Scheme:

The IBM PC was designed in 1981, not 1982.  The MBR format was introduced in
1983 to support the 10 MB hard drive of the IBM PC XT.

The number of logical partitions is unlimited, not restricted to 12.

Exercise 14.1:

Step 1:  The block size of 1 MB for the dd backup is chosen because Linux
starts the first partition on a disk at sector 2048, i.e. the first byte after
1 MB.
