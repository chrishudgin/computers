In the section "Upgrading the Linux Kernel", the number of kernels that are
kept in /boot defaults to four as stated, despite the fact that
installonly_limit=3 in the default yum configuration.  The discrepancy is due
to the fact that one kernel is the rescue kernel installed during initial
system installation, and that kernel is not tracked with an RPM package as the
other kernels are.  This ensures that the rescue kernel will not be deleted
during kernel package installation or removal.
