"Do I Know This Already?" Quiz

3. The correct answer is a, not b.  Shares are marked "read only = yes" by
default, implying "writable = no" (the two settings are synomymous).  However,
with a "write list" specified, even if "read only = yes", all users and groups
in the write list can write to the share if the Linux permissions also allow
them to write.

Conversely, when "read only = no", implying "writable = yes", all authenticated
users can write to the share if the Linux permissions also allow them to write.

4. Answers b is also true; in order for a user to be able to read or write
files on the share, the appropriate Linux permissions must be set on the files.
The "valid users" variable only controls which users and groups can connect to
the share.

8. To clarify, "use_samba_home_dirs" is required on the client side in order
for Linux users to use Samba shares from a remote server as their Linux home
directories.  In contrast, "samba_enable_home_dirs" allows Linux user home
directories on the server side to be shared via Samba.

Creating Shares

The filename should be "smb.conf", not "smb.-conf"

Mounting Samba Shares Through automount

There should be a space or tab between the * and -fstype=cifs in the example
line from /etc/auto.guests.

Exercise 37.5

In step 6, the directory should be /srv/samba/sambashare, and the /srv/samba
directory should be created first.

4. The wording of the question is confusing.  To clarify, "use_samba_home_dirs"
is required on the client side in order for Linux users to use Samba shares
from a remote server as their Linux home directories.  In contrast,
"samba_enable_home_dirs" allows Linux user home directories on the server side
to be shared via Samba.

Lab 37.1

1.

The share called account is probably meant to be read-only to members of the
sales group.

Users linda and laura are members of the sales group but not the account group.
Users lori and bob are members of the account group but not the sales group.

# useradd -s /sbin/nologin -G sales,account smbnobody
# smbpasswd -a smbnobody
(set password to "password")
# smbapasswd -a linda
# smbapasswd -a laura
# smbapasswd -a lori
# smbapasswd -a bob
# mkdir /sales
# mkdir /account
# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t "/sales(/.*)?"
# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t "/account(/.*)?"
# restorecon -Rv /sales
# restorecon -Rv /account
# chgrp sales /sales
# chgrp account /account
# chmod 2775 /sales
# chmod 2775 /account

Add the following lines to /etc/samba/smb.conf:
[sales]
path = /sales
write list = @sales
valid users = @sales, @account

[account]
path = /account
write list = @account
valid users = @account, @sales

# systemctl start smbd
# systemctl start nmbd
# systemctl enable smbd
# systemctl enable nmbd

2.

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
# firewall-cmd --reload

3.

# echo "username=smbnobody" > /root/smb-multiuser
# echo "password=password" >> /root/smb-multiuser
# mkdir /sales
# mkdir /account
# echo "//server1/sales /sales cifs credentials=/root/smb-multiuser,sec=ntlmssp,multiuser,_netdev 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
# echo "//server1/account /account cifs credentials=/root/smb-multiuser,sec=ntlmssp,multiuser,_netdev 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

4.

# su - linda
$ cifscreds add server1
(linda should now be able to write to /sales and read from /account)

# su - bob
$ cifscreds add server1
(bob should now be able to write to /account and read from /sales)
