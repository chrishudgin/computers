PolicyKit enables graphical administrative applications to authenticate
unprivileged users with a graphical pop-up window that prompts for the user's
password (for users that are in the wheel group) or the root password (for
users that are not in the wheel group).

Contrary to what is stated in the book, the groupmems command does NOT list
users who have the specified group as their primary group, only users who have
it as a secondary group.

Show/verify authentication settings:
# authconfig --test

DNS discovery of Kerberos services or IPA services can be used in
authconfig-gtk if the appropriate SRV records have been added to the DNS domain
used by the client.

To specify a different domain to use while joining the client to an IPA server:
# ipa-client-install --domain=somedomain.example.com

To specify that home directories for remote user should be created at initial
login, add --mkhomedir to the ipa-client-install command.
