"Do I Know This Already?" Quiz

10. Neither the answer nor the explanation is entirely correct.  The correct
answer is:

mail -s hello root@server2 < .    (note the trailing dot)

and this works not because a dot is being sent to the mail command as its
standard input text (which is not how input redirection works), but because the
mail command is attempting to read from the current directory (.) and is
immediately receving a status of EOF with an errno of "EISDIR".

The Email Transmission Process

The statement that "the default mail server process cannot receive messages"
only applies to messages coming in from other systems.  The default postfix
server in RHEL 7 can receive messages that are sent from the localhost and can
send messages anywhere.

The "my_network" parameter should be "mynetworks".
