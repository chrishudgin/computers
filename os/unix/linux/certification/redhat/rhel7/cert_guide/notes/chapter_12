In "Do I Know This Already?", question 7 incorrectly states that anacron is
responsible for running hourly jobs.  In fact, cron runs hourly jobs (including
anacron itself) directly.

Likewise for the section "Understanding the Purpose of anacron" and in
"Summary".

In section, "Managing cron Security", the following sentence:

"If the /etc/cron.deny file exists, a user must not be listed in it to be
allowed to set up cron jobs."

should instead read:

"If the /etc/cron.deny file exists, and the /etc/cron.allow file does not
exist, a user must not be listed in /etc/cron.deny to be allowed to set up cron
jobs."

In "Review Questions", a better answer for number 8 is:
"Place the executable script in /etc/cron.daily."
