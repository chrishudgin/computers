"Do I Know This Already?" Quiz

7. The description in the answer of the behavior of nfs_export_all_rw is
incorrect.  Setting this SELinux Boolean to "off" does not disable write access
to all exports.  Rather, it sets stricter limits on which SELinux contexts can
be set on exports that are to be shared read/write.

A better answer to the question would be to export all shares read-only, since
this setting cannot be overridden on the client.

Configuring the NFSv4 Server

Port 20048, not 20049, is used for rpc.mountd.

Testing Client Access with showmount

Port 20048, not 20049, is used for rpc.mountd.

Configuring SELinux for NFSv4

The description of the behavior of nfs_export_all_rw is incorrect.  Setting

Configuring NFSv4 Kerberos Authentication

In the section on /etc/krb5.keytab, the first sentence should read, "... the
NFS server and the NFS client, ...", not "... the NFS server as the NFS
client, ..."

Lab 36.1

1.

On server1:
# yum group install "File and Storage Server"
# mkdir /secureshare
# wget -O /etc/krb5.keytab http://location/of/server1/keytab
# chmod 600 /etc/krb5.keytab
# restorecon -v /etc/krb5.keytab
# echo "/secureshare server2.example.com(sec=krb5p,rw)" >> /etc/exports
# exportfs -rv
# systemctl restart nfs-server
# systemctl restart nfs-secure-server
# systemctl enable nfs-server
# systemctl enable nfs-secure-server
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
# firewall-cmd --reload

On server2:

# yum group install "Network File System Client"
# mkdir /mnt/secure
# wget -O /etc/krb5.keytab http://location/of/server2/keytab
# chmod 600 /etc/krb5.keytab
# restorecon -v /etc/krb5.keytab
# systemctl restart nfs-secure
# systemctl enable nfs-secure
# echo "server1:/secureshare /mnt/secure nfs _netdev,sec=krb5p 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
# mount -a
