For the RHCSA exam, a shared group environment means a directory owned by a
shared group (a secondary group to which multiple accounts belong), with write
permission for the shared group set on the directory, and with the setgid bit
set on the directory.

To ensure that members of the group can delete only their own files in the
directory:

Set the sticky bit on the directory
Set the owner of the directory to an account that is not a member of the shared
   group (e.g. the user nobody or root)

Alternatively, a member of the group could be desginated as the administrator
of the shared directory (able to remove any user's file), in which case they
should be made the owner of the directory.

For additional security, the directory can be made mode 0 for "other".  The
sticky bit will still be effective in this case, although ls will show it with
a capital T rather than a lower case t because the "other execute" bit is
turned off.

If desired, a default ACL can be set on the shared directory to ensure that
any newly created files and directories will be accessible by the group owner:
$ setfacl -d -m group:<groupowner>:rwx /shared/dir
   (new dirs will be rwx by group; new files will be rw- by group)

or that newly created files and directories will not be accessible by "other"
$ sefacl -d -m other:- /shared/dir
