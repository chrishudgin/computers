"Do I Know This Already?"

2.  Correct answers are a and d.

A source domain is a known in SELinux terminology as a subject, not an object.

SELinux prevents Apache httpd processes from executing any scripts it may
create in /tmp and /var/tmp through a set of associated rules:
# sesearch --type --source httpd_t
...
type_transition httpd_t tmp_t : dir httpd_tmp_t;
...
# sesearch --type --source httpd_tmp_t
# sesearch --allow --show_cond --source httpd_tmp_t -p execute

Thus, when an Apache process of type httpd_t creates a file in /tmp or
/var/tmp, it is constrained to do as under the httpd_tmp_t process context to
which it transitions.  Under the httpd_tmp_t process context, it cannot further
transition to another context or execute any file.
