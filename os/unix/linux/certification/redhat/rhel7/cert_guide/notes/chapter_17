Apache main config file is /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

ServerRoot points to config directory location, by default /etc/httpd

DocumentRoot points to top level directory served by httpd, by default
/var/www/html

Directories for drop-in config files for Apache and for its modules are:
/etc/httpd/conf.d
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d

Apache modules are installed in /etc/httpd/modules (symlink to
/usr/lib64/httpd/modules)

Installing the Required Software

"Basic Web Server" is a yum environment group that will install many packages.
To add web server functionality to an existing installation, chose the smaller
yum group "Web Server" instead.
