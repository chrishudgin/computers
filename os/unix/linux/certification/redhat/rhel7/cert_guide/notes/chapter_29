Lab 29.1

One way to limit remote rsyslog messages so that only those sent from server1
(192.168.4.211) are logged and the rest are rejected is to create a firewalld
rich rule like the following:

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.4.211" port port="514" protocol="tcp" accept'
# firewall-cmd --reload
