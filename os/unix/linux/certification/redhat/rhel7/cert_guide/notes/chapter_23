"Do I Know This Already?" Quiz:

8. A direct mount (listed in a direct map) does not require the mount point
directory to exist prior to the automounter starting, but the full path to the
mount point directory is specified in the configuration file.

An automounted filesystem that uses a direct mount can be automounted by any
user, not just root.

Table 23.2:

sec=none is not documented but has the same effect as setting the all_squash
option on the export while leaving sec at the default setting.

Mounting the NFS Share:

The netstat command shown will only show an established connection to the NFS
server after an NFS mount has been performed.

Mounting SMB Shares:

Per mount.cifs(8), the mount.cifs option
   -o username=<name>
is preferred over
   -o user=<name>

Exercise 23.2:

To enable guest mounts, it is necessary to add the following line to the [data]
stanza in /etc/samba/smb.conf on labipa:
   guest ok = yes
and then bounce the Samba server:
# systemctl restart smb

Also do the following on labipa:

# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t '/srv/samba(/.*)?'
# restorecon -FRv /srv/samba

Also if necessary on labipa:

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
# firewall-cmd --reload

Adjust the mount command to the following if necessary to get it to work:

# mount -t cifs -o guest,sec=ntlm //192.168.4.200/data /mnt

Mounting Remote File Systems Through fstab:

It should not be necessary to use the x-systemd.automount mount option.
However, consider using the "bg" mount option for NFS filesystems that may not
be available at boot but are not configured through the automounter.

Mounting NFS Shares through fstab:

The code image is incorrect.  There should be a space rather than a comma
after "nfs".

Using Automount to Mount Remote File Systems

The text is incorrect.  Direct mounts through automount do not require their
mount point directories to exist before the automounter is started.  The
automounter will create them whenever it starts and remove them whenever it
stops, just as with indirect mount points.

Exercise 23.3:

Step 8.  The command should be "cd /shares/data", not "cd /share/data".

Using Wildcards in Automount

In the note, the mount point directory should be /shares/data, not /shares.

Review Questions:

7. Documented syntax is credentials=, not creds=
9. Use a direct mount when you don't have other NFS mounts that need to be
mounted underneath the direct mount's mount point.  With indirect mounts,
in contrast, there are typically many possible subdirectories on which can be
mounted NFS shares (for example, user home directories under /export/home).
