In the dracut shell (the interactive bash shell that runs when the rd.break

available only as arguments to the lvm command, e.g.:

# lvm lvs

instead of

# lvs

The kpartx command in "Recovering Access to a Virtual Machine" step 3 does not
work on RHEL 7.5 with a guest image in .qcow2 format.  Use the guestmount and
guestunmount utilities instead for steps 3-7.
