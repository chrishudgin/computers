Main reasons for failing the RHCSA exam:
https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-rhcsa-reasons-failure/

Remember:

SERVICES (must be enabled and running)
FIREWALL (must be enabled, running, configured for all necessary ports/services)
SELINUX (must be enforcing, verified all with restorecon)
PERSISTENCE/REBOOT (do checks before and after reboot)

Read through all of the questions before starting any work.  Order the tasks
logically in order to ensure related changes are done together and that no
changes will prevent others from being performed.  There are dependencies
between some tasks, though this will not be stated explicitly anywhere in the
exam.

Do a storage inventory to determine what disks, partitions, VGs, free space,
filesystems, and swap currently exist and how they might be used or
reconfigured.

All changes must survive a reboot, so be sure to reboot to ensure they are
correct and persistent.  Reboot often and verify that changes are still in
place.

# yum install bash-completion
and use it wherever possible (such as in firewall-cmd and nmcli).

Activate the GUI (graphical.target) on the host system and VM, if necessary, to
use GUI tools like virt-manager, nm-connection-editor, and authconfig-gtk, and
to have multiple terminal windows open.

Remove rhgb and quiet from boot options.  If necessary, hit [Esc] while booting
in graphical mode to show text-mode messages instead of graphical splash
screen.

"journalctl -e" in single-user mode can be used to review boot messages,
including errors.  If a filesystem entry needs to be fixed in /etc/fstab, run
"systemctl daemon-reload" after fixing it, then "mount -a" to verify that it is
fixed.  The system should then be rebooted to ensure that everything mounts
cleanly.

Expect to have to perform the following tasks before anything else can be done:
   Reset the root password of a system to which you have no login access
      using rd.break to break into the system
   Configure a static IP address (expect NetworkManager to be running)
   Configure a software repository (most likely consisting of a given set of
      packages)
      This will include creating a repo file from scratch in /etc/yum.repos.d
      with a filename extension of .repo (which is mandatory)
      using the syntax described under "[repository] OPTIONS" in yum.conf(5).
      Expect there to be no existing sample repo files on the system.

      The only required directives in a repo file are:
      [repoid]
      name = Some name
      baseurl = http://some.site/some/path  (or ftp or file instead of http)

      The repoid field in brackets must have no spaces but may include dashes.
      Alternatively, generate the repo file with:
      # yum-config-manager --add-repo="http://some.site/some/path"
      
      Then run:
      # yum clean all
      # yum makecache

*****

Shrink an existing partition (FS or swap) non-destructively in order to create
new partitions or LVM physical volumes.  XFS filesystems cannot be shrunk,
although they can be backed up and restored to a smaller size partition or
volume.  Exam candidates report that there are no free partitions or free space
on the test VM's disks (use "parted <device> print free" to show free space).
Possible solutions include:

1. If all four partitions are primary partitions, replace the last with an
extended partition and add logical partitions to it.  The sector boundaries for
the logical partition on the disk will not be the same as those of the primary
partition it replaced, so this is a non-destructive operation only if the last
primary partition (the one that was replaced) was used for swap.
2. Shrinking the existing swap partition by destroying it and re-creating it
at a smaller size to free up space, and then using the freed space to create
a partition for an LVM PV.  The new swap device will have a new UUID, so
/etc/fstab must be edited to reflect this before a reboot.
3. Removing a swap partition and, after following step 2 above, creating an
LV for swap (ensuring that it's activated at boot in /etc/fstab).
4. pvmove could be used to migrate LV extents off of a disk or partition,
freeing that disk or partition for other use:
# pvmove <source_PV> [<destination_PV>]
# vgreduce <vgname> <source_PV>
# pvremove <source_PV>

To extend a logical volume and a filesystem mounted on it in a single step:
# lvresize -r -L +1G /dev/vg01/lv01
# lvresize -r -L +50%FREE /dev/vg01/lv01
(be sure to include the "+" to add the amount of space specified)

Storage-related tasks should be grouped together and done early.

Run "mount -a" to verify correctness of /etc/fstab before rebooting.

*****

In general, perform potentially destructive tasks first.  If the system becomes
completely broken, ask the exam proctor to reset it.  There are reports of
VM issues during the exame that are caused by malfunctioning insfrastructure
rather than mistakes made by exam candidates.

Modify a Kickstart file to meet specified requirements, such as using a
networked installation repo:
url --url=http://some/page

When setting up cron or at jobs, make sure that jobs are set up correctly for
AM/PM and do not run at any extraneous times (as might happen with the
day-of-month and day-of-week fields being set simultaneously in a crontab
entry).  Verify that the command works outside of cron or at (including
executable permissions), and that cron and at themselves are working.

Make sure that all necessary daemons are running and enabled (they must start
automatically at boot).

An exam task to set up periodic cleaning of temporary files is probably
intended to make use of systemd-tmpfiles with a custom *.conf file in
/etc/tmpfiles.d.

Remember to include --permanent in firewall-cmd commands if appropriate.
All services that must be accessible from outside the VM (like ssh) must be
persistently opened in the firewall.

Remember to include /tcp or /udp after port numbers in firewall-cmd --add-port:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1234/tcp

Put SELinux into Enforcing mode, persistently

Troubleshoot SELinux AVC denials, including suggested actions:
Make sure sealert is installed:
# yum install setroubleshoot-server
Find the AVC denied error in /var/log/messages and run the specified sealert
command, e.g.
# sealert -l 1e03907c-40ef-4f38-9293-349cdb47795b
OR
# sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log

Set an SELinux boolean.  A description of each boolean can be shown with:
# semanage boolean -l

Include -P to setsebool to make changes persistent.

DO NOT (may cause problems on exam system):
Install SELinux policy man pages, index them in the man database, and use
examples in the resulting man pages to configure SELinux file contexts and
booleans to provide requested functionality for a service:
# yum whatprovides sepolicy
(The package is policycoreutils-devel)
# yum install policycoreutils-devel
# sepolicy manpage -a -p /usr/share/man/man8
# mandb
# man -k _selinux | grep <some_service_like_ftpd>

Set SELinux file contexts persistently using "semanage fcontext" (using a
regular expression for the target directory and its children) and restorecon.

*****

Set up remote authentication with:
# yum install authconfig-gtk sssd krb5-workstation
# authconfig-gtk
   Be sure to unselect the DNS checkbox
or, if connecting to an ipa server:
# yum install ipa-client
# ipa-client-install [--domain=example.com] [--no-ntp] [--mkhomedir]

*****

CIFS client mounts are done with mount.cifs, part of the package cifs-utils.
smbclient (for listing shares) is provided by the package samba-client.
# yum install cifs-utils samba-client
Also open the samba-client service with firewalld:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba-client
# firewall-cmd --reload

Include _netdev mount option for network-based filesystem entries in /etc/fstab.

RH134 suggests using mount option "sync" for NFS mounts, including automounts
of user home directories, and always specifying the necessary security mount
option explicitly, e.g. sec=sys or sec=krb5p.

Discovery of NFSv4 shares can be done by mounting the pseudo-root filesystem
of the NFS server on the client.

Kerberized NFS mounts require /etc/krb.keytab, the nfs-secure service to
be running, and a krb5[ip] mount option.

Automounter map files in /etc/auto.master.d must have a filename extension of
.autofs (e.g. home.autofs).

Don't forget to include a colon : before the name of an SMB share or local
device (like /dev/sdb1) in an autofs map file:
/mysmb1	-fstype=cifs,credentials=/root/smb.cred	://server1/smb1

Expect to have to configure LDAP authentication for users and then automount
for their home directories.

*****

Tasks that are NOT likely to be on the exam:
    Install RHEL in a virtual machine (it takes too long)
    Boot from a rescue disk
