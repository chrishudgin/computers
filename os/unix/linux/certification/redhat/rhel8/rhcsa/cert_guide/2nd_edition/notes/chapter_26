Some commands shown in this chapter do not work with the podman 1.0.2-dev
implementation included in RHEL 8.0, but do work correctly in later versions of
podman such as 2.2.1 in RHEL 8.3.

Examples include:

The Ctrl-P, Ctrl-Q key sequence to detach from a container running in the
foreground.

Exercise 26-3:
1. The "-d" and "--rm" options used together in a "podman run" command

Exercise 26-4:
1. Port bindings (in this exercise, -p 8080:80) in a rootless container

Exercise 26-5:
8. Port bindings in a rootless container

Exerise 26-6:
2. Port bindings in a rootless container (implicit binding to port 3306)

Exercise 26-7:
6. Port bindings in a rootless container
8. Generating a systemd unit file with "podman generate systemd"

*****

Exercise 26-4: The firewall rule shown in step 3 is not necessary when
connecting to port 8080 from the localhost itself, as in step 4.  However, it
is necessary if connecting to port 8080 from a remote host.

Exercise 26-7:
3. "loginctl enable-linger <username>" can also be run by the affected user
without using sudo.
10. In RHEL 8.3, default.target is automatically included in the WantedBy
directive generated by the "podman generate systemd" command, along with
multi-user.target.
