# In paste's serial mode, a newline is added after each input argument is
# completely processed, even if the argument's content did not include a
# trailing newline.

$ paste -s paste4 paste5
abc	def	ghi
jkl mno	pqr	stu vwx

# In contrast, when the input to paste is combined into a single argument by
# cat-ing all input together initially, there are no intermediate newlines
# added.  A trailing newline is still inserted by paste itself, per POSIX.
