# When sorting the input below (and the -b option to ignore leading blanks is
# NOT given), the second field begins with the space character following the
# "a" and continues through the next non-blank character (b or B or d).

# When the input below is sorted in a UTF locale, it will sort in the order
# shown since in UTF, whitespace is not used for collation (sorting) and
# case is ignored.
 
# When the input below is sorted in a C locale, it will sort in the order
# opposite of that shown since in the C locale (ASCII), spaces precede letters
# and capitals precede lower case letters.  Thus "  d" (space space d) precedes
# " B" (space B) precedes " b" (space b).

# When -b and -k 2 are given, C locale sorts "a B" before "a b" before "a  d".
# When -b and -k 2 are given, UTF locale sorts "a b" before "a B" before "a  d".

a b
a B
a  d
