# no quotes, so bash interprets escaped chars itself (in this case, simply
# replacing \b with a literal b) and does not pass on the escape sequences to
# echo:
$ echo -e abc\bd   # echo is passed the string abcbd, not abc\bd
abcbd

# escaped chars are quoted, so the escape sequences are passed on verbatim
# to echo:
$ echo -e "abc\bd" 
abd

# chars are doubly escaped, so the resulting escape sequences are passed on
# to echo:
$ echo -e abc\\bd   # bash replaces \\ with \ and passes on abc\bd to echo
abd
