Determine and configure hardware settings

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is EFI 2.x
EFI reads the boot loader from the EFI System Partition (ESP) on the selected
	boot device.
EFI uses LBA mode exclusively for addressing hard disk sectors.

hald provides user-mode programs with information about available hardware.

D-Bus provides hardware event notification and IPC.

udev manages /dev dynamically.  Configured in /etc/udev.

setpci can be used to query and set PCI devices' configurations.
lspci will list PCI devices and their information.
	-t option will display PCI tree

Kernel modules are located in /lib/modules.

lsmod will list modules loaded and how many modules or processes are using
	each one

modinfo gives information about a module

insmod does not load modules on which the specified module depends,
	so insmod may fail if a dependency has not already been met.
insmod takes a filename as its argument, followed by options to the
	module loaded by the specified file.

modprobe does handle dependencies and will load all necessary modules in order.
	modprobe takes a module name, not a filename, as its argument.
modprobe uses /etc/modprobe.conf as a configuration file, as well as files
	in /etc/modprobe.d.
modprobe has many options, such as:
	-r: remove modules
	--show-depends (information only)
	-l:  list all known modules

Modules can also be loaded automatically in some situations.

rmmod removes a module by module name

Common USB controller names are OHCI and UHCI.
lsusb lists USB devices and takes a number of options.
/proc/bus/usb contains low-level info for USB devices.
usbmgr detects changes in USB connections and (un)loads appropriate modules
	according to config files in /etc/usbmgr like /etc/usbmgr/usbmgr.conf.

More common than usbmgr today is the Hotplug package, which uses config files
	in /etc/hotplug like /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap

SCSI device lettering is assigned in increasing order based on SCSI ID
	(ascending from 0 or descending from 7 and then from 14, depending
	on the adapter) and then by adapter (all devices from first adapter,
	then all devices from second adapter, etc.).

	Lettering is not persistent, so addition or removal of SCSI devices
	or buses can change the letters assigned to all SCSI devices, including
	those that were present previously.
