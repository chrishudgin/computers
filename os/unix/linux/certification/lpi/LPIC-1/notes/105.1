Customize and use the shell environment

By default, aliases are not expanded in shell scripts.  To change this behavior:
    shopt -s expand_aliases
Each alias is expanded once, not recursively.  Thus:
$ alias ls='ls -F'  is valid

If an alias ends with a space, as in:
$ alias cd='cd '
then the next word on the command line following the aliased command and space
is also checked for alias expansion.  For example:
$ alias cd='cd '
$ alias foo=/bar
$ cd foo   # changes directory to /bar
