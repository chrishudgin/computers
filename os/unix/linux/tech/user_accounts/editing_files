vipw and vigr exist for direct editing of password and group files.

vipw : edit /etc/passwd
vipw -s : edit /etc/shadow
vigr : edit /etc/group
vigr -s : edit /etc/gshadow

These commands each create and edit a temporary file called <filename>.edit and
then copy the edited file into place when done.  They block simultaneous access
to the files from other vipw/vigr commands.  They do not prevent simultaneous
edit access to the files through regular vi commands.
