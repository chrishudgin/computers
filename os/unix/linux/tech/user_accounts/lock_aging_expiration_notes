passwd -S <username> : show whether username's account is locked
   This command will not indicate directly whether the user's password or
   account has expired, but these conditions can be inferred from the numbers
   displayed from /etc/shadow.  To see the expiration dates, use:

chage -l <username> : show password/account aging and expiration values
   expressed as calendar dates

*****

Reference: shadow(5)

When a user's password is within "warn" days of expiration, the user is
warned but not required to change their password when they log in.

When a user's password expires, the user must change their password the next
time they log in.

After a specified number of "inactive" days after password expiration, the
user's account expires.

*****

Delete existing password (if any) and set a locked password, which disallows
logins using static Unix password authentication:

# passwd -d <username>
# passwd -l <username>

*****

When a user's account expires, the user is no longer permitted to log in at
all.

# usermod -e YYYY-MM-DD <username> : set username's password to expire on date
  That is, the user will be allowed to continue logging in until the *end* of
  the specified day.
# passwd -e <username> : expire username's password immediately
  (sets user's password last changed field to 0 in /etc/shadow, which by
   definition means the password has expired)

*****

All account password and account aging/locking settings can be managed with
passwd(1), usermod(8), and/or chage(1)
