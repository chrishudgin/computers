Log into a user or group and run a command, then return to original shell :

su [-] someuser -c "/some/command with args, in quotes"
OR
su [-] someuser /some/command with args, no quotes

sg [-] somegroup -c "/some/command with args, in quotes"
sg [-] somegroup /some/command with args, no quotes

Note that when -c is used, the entire command line to run must be a single
string and must therefore be enclosed in quotes or have white space escaped if
it consists of multiple components.  This convention differs from that of sudo,
which requires that the command components be separate tokens (strings).

Using sudo's "Runas" (another user or group) capability:
  
$ sudo [-i] -u testuser some command with args
$ sudo [-i] -g testgroup some command with args
