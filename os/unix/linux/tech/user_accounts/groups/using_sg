When running commands with su (switch user) and sg (switch group), use the -c
option followed by a quoted command string.

$ su [-] <username> -c 'some command string'
$ sg [-] <groupname> -c 'some command string'

This is the opposite convention that sudo uses; a sudo command string should not
be enclosed entirely in quotes.
