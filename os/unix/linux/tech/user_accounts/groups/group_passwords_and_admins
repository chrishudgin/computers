By default, groups do not have passwords.  However, a password can be set for
any group by a group administrator or superuser.

Once a password for a group is set, any user who is not defined as a member of
the group (in /etc/passwd, /etc/group, or /etc/gshadow) can log into the group
(via newgrp or sg) if they know the password.

By default, a group has no administrators.  To set the group administrator
list, overwriting any previous list of administrators for the group:

# gpasswd -A <username1>,<username2>,... <groupname>

The next to last and last fields of /etc/gshadow are the administrators and
members of a group, respectively.  It is possible for a user to be an
administrator for a group but not a member of that group, although a group
administrator could set an aribitrary password for the group and then log into
it with that password.

To remove a group password:

# gpasswd -r <groupname>

If no password is set for a group, newgrp and sg commands to log into that
group by users who are not members of it will first prompt for the
(nonexistent) group password and then deny access.
