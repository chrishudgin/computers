"reboot" records begin when a system begins booting (not shutting down) and
extend to the beginning of the next boot.

Records that end in "crash" do not necessarily mean that the system crashed.
"crash" means only that the listed user has a login record in wtmp but not a
logout record.  This could be due to a system crash or any reboot of the server
while a user was logged into the graphical desktop.
