The default action at the end of a Kickstart installation is "halt", which
prompts the user before rebooting the system.  The following actions can
be added to a Kickstart configuration file:

halt (prompt, then reboot)
shutdown (shut down without prompting)
poweroff (same as shutdown)
reboot [--eject] (reboot without prompting, optionally ejecting CD/DVD first)

The desired action directive should be added *before* the %packages section of
the Kickstart configuration file.
