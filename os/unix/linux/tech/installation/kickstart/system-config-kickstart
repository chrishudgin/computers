The Kickstart Configurator is installed with:
# yum install system-config-kickstart

Kickstart Configurator does not support the creation of LVM logical volumes
or allow individual packages to be selected for installation.

To begin with an existing Kickstart configuration file (optional):
# system-config-kickstart /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
