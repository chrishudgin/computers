When booted to install media, a location for a Kickstart configuration file can
be appended to the kernel command line by pressing Tab while the "Install"
option is highlighted in the installer text menu.

Syntax for specifying the location of a Kickstart configuration file on the
installer's kernel command line is:

ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg
ks=hd:sdb1:/ks.cfg
ks=hd:fd0:/ks.cfg
ks=ftp://192.168.122.1/pub/ks.cfg
ks=http://192.168.122.1/ks.cfg
ks=nfs:192.168.122.1:/ks.cfg

To specify a Kickstart configuration file to be used with virt-install:

# virt-install ...
-x ks=file:/my.ks
-x ks=...  (see other examples above)

If the Kickstart configuration file is placed on an anonymous FTP server, it
should be world-readable and have the correct SELinux context for a file in
its directory.
