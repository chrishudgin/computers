Anaconda sets up the following virtual console windows during installation:

Ctrl-Alt-F1: tmux terminal multiplexer (/dev/pts/*) on tty1
Ctrl-Alt-F2: root shell on tty2
Ctrl-Alt-F3: root shell on tty3
Ctrl-Alt-F4: syslog on tty4 (also sent to file /tmp/syslog)
   syslog is configured for *.*;authpriv.none;local1.none
   Anaconda uses local1 facility and also logs its messages directly elsewhere
     (see tmux section below)
Ctrl-Alt-F5: root shell on tty5
Ctrl-Alt-F6: graphical installer or, if installer is running in text mode,
   root shell on tty6

tmux terminals (/dev/pts/*) multiplexed on tty1:

Ctrl-b 1: Main Anaconda window including stderr from anaconda
   Installer user interface for text installs
Ctrl-b 2: root shell on /dev/pts/1
Ctrl-b 3: Anaconda installation log (tail -F /tmp/anaconda.log)
Ctrb-b 4: Storage log (tail -F /tmp/storage.log)
Ctrl-b 5: Logs from other utilities (tail -F /tmp/program.log)
