Each slave pseudoterminal device /dev/pts/[01...] has an independent master
pseudoterminal created when a process opens /dev/ptmx.  When a process is
running through a remote ssh session and it sends output to a pts device (e.g.
though standard output), the slave's pseudoterminal device sends the output to
its pseudoterminal master, which then is then processed by sshd and sent over
the network.  The process running through ssh (e.g. bash) does not see its
output going to a network socket or sshd, only to the pseudoterminal slave,
just as it would when running in a local GUI terminal.
