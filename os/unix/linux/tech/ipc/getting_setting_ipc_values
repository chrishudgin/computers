The standard Unix ipcs command can be used to display existing shared memory
segments, semaphores, and message queues as well as their system-level limits.

Alternatively, the system limits can be shown by:

Shared memory:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/shm{all,max,mni}

The value for shmmin (minimum shared memory segment size) is nominally set to 1
byte but has an effective minimum size of one memory page (4096 bytes).

Semaphores:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/sem
(shows semmsl, semmns, semopm, and semmni)

Message queues:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/msg{max,mnb,mni}

*****

System limits for shared memory, semaphore, and message queue parameters can be
set dynamically by modifying the values in the kernel pseudo-files above
directly or by using the sysctl command (and /etc/sysctl.{conf,d/*.conf} for
persistence), as in these examples:

# sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=18446744073692774399
# sysctl -w kernel.sem="250 32000 100 128"
# sysctl -w kernel.msgmax=8192
