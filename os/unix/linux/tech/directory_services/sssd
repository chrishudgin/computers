SSSD (System Security Service Daemon) provides caching for offline
authentication when the designated LDAP server is temporarily unavailable.  It
can be used instead of nslcd for this purpose.

Unlike nslcd, sssd can also (in additon to LDAP authentication) handle
authentication to Active Directory, Kerberos, and IPA (Identity, Policy, and
Audit server).

Install the package sssd, which adds many dependencies.

By default, there is no /etc/sssd/sssd.conf file, but authconfig-* will create
it.

Example /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:

id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
chpass_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://127.0.0.1
ldap_id_use_start_tls = True
ldap_tls_cacertdir = /etc/openldap/cacerts
[sssd]
services = nss, pam
config_file_version = 1
domains = default

When using sssd, entries in /etc/nsswitch.conf should be as follows:
passwd: files sss
shadow: files sss
group: files sss

Enable and start the sssd service:
# systemctl enable sssd
# systemctl start sssd
