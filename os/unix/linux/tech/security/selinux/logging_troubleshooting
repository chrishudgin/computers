SELinux logs to /var/log/audit/audit.log if auditd is running
   and to /var/log/messages if rsyslogd is running.

Disable "dontaudit" policy statements in SELinux (i.e. enable full auditing):
# semodule -DB

Rebuild policy with "dontaudit" policy statements enabled:
# semodule -B

Show detailed information for hex_alert_ID shown in /var/log/messages:
# sealert -l hex_alert_ID
   # sealert -l 2057ea76-0d25-4004-8637-d1c24538181a

Show all SELinux alerts (denials) along with suggestions for commands to enable
the access that was denied:
# sealart -a /var/log/audit/audit.log

Each AVC (Access Vector Cache) record contains the attempted operation (such as
"execute"), PID, command, path or name of target object, and the source and
target contexts.
