Show SELinux context of a file:
# ls -Z <filename>

Preserve a copied file's SELinux context:
# cp --preserve=context /from/file /to/file
OR
# cp -a /from/file /to/file

Copying a file using cp without options or with -p will not preserve its
SELinux context.  Instead, the copy of the file, just as any newly created
file, will inherit the SELinux context of its destination directory, regardless
of what the default context of the file would be as determined by policy from
the file /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/file/file_contexts.  Thus, running
restorecon on a newly created file will in some cases change its context, and
will in any event ensure that the file's context matches the context from
policy.
