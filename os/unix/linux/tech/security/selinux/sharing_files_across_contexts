SHARING FILES
If you want to share files with multiple domains (Apache, FTP, rsync,
Samba), you can set a file context of public_content_t and public_con-
tent_rw_t. These context allow any of the above domains to read the
content. If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.

Allow ftpd servers to read the /var/ftpd directory by adding the pub-
lic_content_t file type to the directory and by restoring the file
type.

semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t "/var/ftpd(/.*)?"
restorecon -F -R -v /var/ftpd
