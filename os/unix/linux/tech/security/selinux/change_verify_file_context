All file context rules are contained in:
/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts[.local]Change file context

*****

Set file context:
# chcon [-R] -u <selinux_user> -r <selinux_role> -t <selinux_type> <filename>
   -R : recurse through directories

Set file context to match that of another file:
# chcon --reference=<sourcefile> <destfile>

Caution: a filesystem relabel will reset all file contexts back to their
policy-defined values.  Permanent changes to contexts must be backed by
corresponding policy changes (through semanage fcontext).

*****

Restore file context

By default, if a file already has a security context, restorecon will restore
only the type portion of the context, not the user, role, and range portions.

Restore full SELinux context to a file (not just type):
# restorecon -F [-R] [-v] <filename>
  -F : full context restore
  -R : recurse through directories
  -v : show any changes made to context

This is useful immediately after replacing a system file, e.g. copying back
from a saved original that might not have the correct context for the system
file.

*****

Verify file context

Show correct SELinux context for a file per policy (type can be file, dir,
pipe, etc.):
# matchpathcon [-m type] <filename>

Verify if SELinux context for file is correct
# matchpathcon -V <filename>
