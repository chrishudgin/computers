*****

Services (like httpd and ftpd) and users (like user_u and guest_u) that are
confined by SELinux have HTML descriptions of their SELinux properties in the
selinux-policy-devel package, under /usr/share/selinux/devel/html.

To install the user- and service-specific *_selinux HTML documents and man
pages:
   # yum install selinux-policy-devel policycoreutils-devel
   # sepolicy manpage -a|-d <process_domain> -p /usr/share/man/man8
   # mandb
   # man httpd_selinux; man guest_selinux

The associated man pages are generated dynamically by "sepolicy manpage" each
time it is run so that they reflect the currently loaded policy with respect to
items like ports and file contexts associated with a user or service.  If
changes are made to a user or service's SELinux policy (like adding an
associated port with semanage port), the man pages for that user or service
should be regenerated using the above commands to document the local policy
changes.

The "sepolicy manpage" command options are documented in sepolicy-manpage(8).
