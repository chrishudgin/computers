When changing policy from SELinux disabled to enforcing, first set state to
permissive in /etc/selinux/config and reboot, then set policy to enforcing and
reboot again.  Setting policy to permissive first ensures that all files will
be labeled during the first boot so that services will not fail to start once
enforcing mode is set during the next reboot.

The SELinux mode can also be set on the kernel command line to make it
effective during a single boot session:

Disabled: selinux=0
Enabled: selinux=1
Permissive: enforcing=0
Enforcing: enforcing=1
