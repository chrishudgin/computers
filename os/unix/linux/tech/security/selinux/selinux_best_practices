If transitioning from Disabled, start with Permissive and allow a soak time so that AVC errors can be addressed
with policies.  Then switch to Enforcing.

Applications that use or interact with the built-in Apache web server tend to have more problems working seamlessly
with SELinux since Apache has SELinux restrictions imposed on it.  They also tend to require some developer education.

Applications that do not interact with Apache or other SELinux-aware services tend not to have problems since they
run in an unconfined SELinux context.

Consider putting a statement into /etc/issue indicating that a server is running SELinux in Enforcing mode.
