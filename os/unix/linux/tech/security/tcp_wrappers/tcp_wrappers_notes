Note: TCP Wrappers is deprecated in RHEL 7 and is not available in RHEL 8 or
higher.  The replacement tool for limiting access by service and incoming IP
address is firewalld, which is a wrapper for iptables or nftables rules applied
to the kernel's netfilter subsystem.

TCP Wrappers and daemons linked to libwrap.so allow access by default

For a new connection, hosts.allow is checked first; if no match, then
   hosts.deny is checked; if still no match, access is allowed

File syntax is:

daemon[@server] : [username@]client[, ...] [ : spawn|twist /some/command ]
...
where server and client can be hostname or IP address patterns

Example:
# cat /etc/hosts.deny
sshd : foo.bar.com

/etc/hosts.{allow,deny} permits IPv4 network addresses to be specified with
   CIDR notation

A client list specifier in /etc/hosts.[allow|deny] can include wildcards (? and
   * in IP addresses; ALL to match all daemon binary names or all hosts) or
   partial specifications like .foo.com or 192.168. if wildcards are not used
   in the same specification string; it also supports specifying a filename
   (with full path) containing additional specifiers and exceptions to a list
   match with the EXCEPT keyword (e.g. .foo.bar EXCEPT bad.foo.bar)

Some services support allowing/denying connections from a particular username,
   as in this example:

   myservice: joe@foo.bar.com

   sshd does NOT support access control by username in hosts.{allow,deny}
   configure sshd user access control with the AllowUsers and DenyUsers
   directives in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

spawn runs a specified shell command in addition to the named daemon
twist runs a specified shell instead of the named daemon

Other options are available in the third field to control a daemon's
   environment and the user/group under which it runs

tcpdmatch(8) is a tool for testing whether a connection from a specified client
   to a specified daemon would be allowed or denied.

   Example:

   # tcpdmatch sshd tester1.example.com
   client:   hostname tester1.example.com
   client:   address  192.168.122.150
   server:   process  sshd
   access:   denied
