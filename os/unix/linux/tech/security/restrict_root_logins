Various means of preventing direct root logins in RHEL 7 are described at:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/sec-controlling_root_access

For example, preventing direct root login in GDM requires adding a requirement
(an extra configuration line in /etc/pam.d/*gdm*) for PAM-aware GDM services to
use pam_securetty.so in addition to other modules that they use by default.

Limit root login access on consoles by commenting out entries in /etc/securetty

*****

To limit use of the "su" command to members of the wheel group, uncomment the
following line in /etc/pam.d/su:
#auth           required        pam_wheel.so use_uid
