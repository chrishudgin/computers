STONITH can be managed by RHHA 7 as a resource type

For resource management, each node runs crmd (Cluster Resource Manager Daemon)
and lrmd (Local Resource Manager Daemon).  lrmd acts as an interface between
crmd and agents.

Membership and quorum configuration is stored in /etc/corosync/corosync.conf

Cluster node and resource configuration is stored in
   /var/lib/pacemaker/cib/cib.xml

Cluster service daemons are grouped under the pcd.service systemd service.

The pcs command is the main administrative command for cluster setup and
operations.

The Web UI uses the hacluster user account.

For administrative commands, a resource group is treated as a resource.

Resources in a resource group are started in the order in which they were
added to a resource group.
