To exclude packages persistently from being subject to yum commands like "yum
install" or "yum update", edit /etc/yum.conf to set the "exclude" configuration
option:

exclude=<pkgname1>[,<pkgname2>,...]

Example:

exclude=kernel,ksh,virt-who

Wildcards (*) are allowed.

Do not specify more than one exclude statement per repo, since only the last
exclude statement in the repo file is used.
