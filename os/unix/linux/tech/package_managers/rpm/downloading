Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/10154 (yum downloader)

Download one or more RPMs to the current directory without installing them:
# yumdownloader <pkgname>

Wildcards are supported:
# yumdownloader 'libvirt-*'

Download a source RPM (SRPM):
# yumdownloader --source <pkgname>

*****

Download a package instead of installing it during an interactive yum
transaction:
# yum update
(Answer "d" to the y/d/N confirmation prompt)

The file will be placed under the yum cache directory for the repository from
which the package was retrieved
(e.g. /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7Server/rhel-7-server-rpms/packages)

Remove downloaded packages from /var/cache/yum with:
# yum clean packages

*****

To verify the integrity of the downloaded file:
# rpm -K <pkgfile>     (or -Kv to add the display of signatures)
