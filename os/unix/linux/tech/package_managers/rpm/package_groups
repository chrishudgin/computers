RPM PACKAGE GROUPS

Show group membership of a package:

# rpm -qg pkgname

Show all installed package group names:

# rpm -qa --queryformat '%{GROUP}\n' | sort | uniq

YUM ENVIRONMENTS AND YUM PACKAGE GROUPS

Environments bundle package groups, which in turn bundle packages.

A package can be in more than one group.

Group names are not case-sensitive.

List the environments:

# yum groups list environment

Show the package groups in an environment:

# yum groups info 'Server with GUI'

Show the packages in a group:

# yum groups info base

Each package in the group is shown with an indicator as follows:
= : installed as part of the group
+ : will be installed as part of the group
- : excluded and will not be installed as part of the group
(no preceding character) : not installed as part of the group or not installed
at all

List all package groups, including "hidden" ones, along with their IDs:
(Hidden groups are those that are normally installed through an environment
group)

# repoquery -ag  (does not include environment groups)
OR
# yum groups list ids hidden

Show the groups to which a package belongs:
# repoquery --groupmember <pkgname>

Install missing packages from an environment:
(should not be necessary on RHEL 7; just use "yum groups install <groupname>")

# yum groups mark install "Server with GUI"
# yum groups mark convert "Server with GUI"
# yum groups install "Server with GUI"

Install one or more environment groups and/or package groups:

# yum groups install "Virtualization Host" "Virtualization Client"
(in this example, "Virtualization Host" is an environment group
 and "Virtualization Client" is a package group)

Mandatory packages are always installed and cannot be excluded.
Default packages are installed unless they are excluded.
   Packages appearing in the default list that were not installed when a group
   was installed may have been added to the group by the repo maintainer at a
   later date, after the package group was first installed on the system.
   A subsequent "yum group install <groupname>"
   or "yum group update <groupname" will install the missing default packages.
   "yum update" by itself will not install missing default packages.
Optional packages are not installed as part of group.

Note that in some groups, like "Remote Desktop Client", all packages are listed
as "optional".  In such a case, no packages will be installed as part of an
installation of the group.

Install a package group while excluding some packages from installation:
# yum groups install print-server -x gutenprint-cups -x paps

Remove packages that were installed as part of a group:
# yum groups remove print-server
