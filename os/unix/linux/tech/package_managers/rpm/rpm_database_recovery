A hanging rpm command may be a sign of database corruption.

The RPM database is stored in Berkeley DB format in /var/lib/rpm.  If the RPM
database is in an inconsistent state, RPM commands may fail or hang.  To
attempt to put the RPM database into a consistent state by replaying
transactions:

Kill any processes that have the RPM database open.  Then run:
# /usr/bin/db_recover -h /var/lib/rpm

Sometimes only the indexes are corrupted, or there are stale locks.
Indexes and stale locks can safely be removed:

Kill any processes that have the RPM database open.  Then run:
# rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__db.*
Any subsequent rpm command will recreate the index files.  To rebuild them
immediately:
# rpm [-v[v]] --rebuilddb
# cd /var/lib/rpm
# /usr/lib/rpm/rpmdb_verify Packages (to ensure the database is valid)

systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service also removes /var/lib/rpm/__db.* at boot
