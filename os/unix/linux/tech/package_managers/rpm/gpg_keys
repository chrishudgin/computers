Package signing public keys are stored in /etc/pki/rpm-gpg.

Keys provided by the distribution vendor (e.g. Red Hat) are installed during
initial system installation.

Keys are also represented as packages with package names of the form
'gpg-pubkey-<KEYID>' in the RPM database, and as such can be queried with
rpm -qi <pkgname>.

The first time yum handles a package signed with one of the preinstalled GPG
keys, it will prompt for confirmation to use that key.
