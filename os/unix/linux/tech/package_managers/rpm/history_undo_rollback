A summary log of all package actions (installation, removal, update) is stored
in /var/log/yum.log.

The yum history database is stored in the directory /var/lib/yum/history.

Show yum transaction history summary including sequence numbers, optionally
filtered by one or more package names:
# yum history list [all | <pkgname1> <pkgname2> ...]
(Note: the characters EE in the "Altered" column of the output mean that a
package's script displayed a message during the transaction--not necessarily
an error message.)

"all" means all transactions, not just the most recent ones.

Show details of a yum transaction by sequence number:
# yum history info 44

Undo a single yum transaction by sequence number:
# yum history undo 45

Redo a single yum transaction by sequence number:
# yum history redo 45

Rollback to a previous yum transaction (undoes all transactions subsequent to
given transaction number):
# yum history rollback 41
