An RPM package can be configured by the package maintainer to save existing
configuration files during package upgrade in one of two ways:

1. Keep the existing configuration file intact without renaming it, and install
the new configuration file with the filename extension .rpmnew.  This can be
done if the existing configuration file is compatible with the new version of
the software package.

2. Rename the existing configuration file with the filename extension .rpmsave
and install the new configuration file with its default name.  This can be done
if the existing configuration file is not compatible with the new version of
the software package.  Any desired customizations from the old version of the
configuration file may have to be merged by hand (if applicable) into the new
version of the file.

During package removal, if a configuration file's content no longer matches
what was orginally installed with the package, the file will in most cases be
preserved in its current directory location with a filename extension of
.rpmsave.

If a package that has had a configuration file customized is removed and then
later reinstalled, the .rpmsave version of the configuration file will not be
moved back into place as the active configuration file.  The .rpmsave version
of the configuration file must be manually moved or merged to be used again.
