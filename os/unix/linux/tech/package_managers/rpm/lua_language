RPM allows the use of an embedded programming language called Lua for
scriptlets.  Lua can be used in the absence of a Unix shell and associated Unix
tools (or before they are installed).

The bash RPM, for example, has its postinstall and postuninstall scriptlets
written in Lua for inserting and removing entries into /etc/shells.
