The /var/lib/yum/yumdb/* directories contain one subdirectory with metadata
files for each package that was installed through yum and is either still
installed or was removed outside of yum's control (i.e. through an rpm
command).

Synchronize yum db to RPM db, using package data from enabled repos:
# yumdb sync
(this will also recreate /var/lib/yum/yumdb if it is missing)
