Create repo metadata necessary for a package collection to be used as a repo:

Place the packages in /some/path or /some/path/Packages.
Place group info and other metadata into .xml files, if desired (optional).
Run:
# createrepo /some/path

Add an entry for the repo in clients' .repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d.

The repo can now be used to list packages, package metadata (like dependencies
and changelogs), and package contents.

*****

Removing the repo consists of removing the directory /some/path/repodata and
removing the .repo file entry in /etc/yum.repos.d on clients.
