to the persistent list:
# yum --enablerepo=rhel-6-server-optional-rpms install rubygems

Force selection from a particular repository:
# yum --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo=rhel-6-server-optional-rpms install rubygems

Enable a repo persistently:
# yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms

Disable package selection from Red Hat Subscription Manager repos:
Move /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo to a different directory (e.g. /root).
Set enabled=0 in /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf
# yum clean all
