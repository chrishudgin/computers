There is no native "nettop" tool in RHEL that will show which processes are
using the most network bandwidth, but there is a two-step equivalent:

1.  Use iptraf to determine which TCP/UDP ports are being used to send the most
traffic.

2.  Use lsof to match the TCP/UDP port numbers to PIDs.


To report real-time bandwidth utilization per NIC (similar to nicstat), use
# sar -n DEV 1

To report real-time error counts (errors per second), use:
# sar -n EDEV 1

Error statistics are collected in:
# ethtool -S <iface>
