To access the default file (e.g. index.html or index.php) in a directory using
curl, a terminating / must be present in the URL.

For example, to access the file mysubdir/index.html on server1 where mysubdir
is directly under the DocumentRoot, use

curl http://server1/mysubdir/
OR
curl http://server1/mysubdir/index.html
NOT
curl http://server1/mysubdir

The latter form will work on some browsers (e.g. Firefox) which follow
redirects automatically, but curl does not do this.

Alternatively, use the -L option to curl to follow redirects:

curl -L http://server1/mysubdir
