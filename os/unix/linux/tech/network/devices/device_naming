Ethernet devices are named as follows in RHEL 7:

1. If the biosdevname package is installed and biosdevname is not set to 0 on
the kernel command line, BIOS naming is used.  biosdevname=1 is the default on
Dell servers.

BIOS naming scheme if supported and biosdevname=1:
em1 (embedded NIC 1)
p4p1 (PCI slot 4, port 1)

Otherwise, if bus topology can be determined and net.ifnames != 0 :
eno1 (onboard NIC 1)
ens33 (hot plug slot 33)
enp0s17 (PCI bus 0, PCI address 11 (hex) on bus, i.e. 17 in decimal)

2. If BIOS device naming is not in use, and net.ifnames is not set to 0, device
may optionally be named by its MAC address, but this scheme is not enabled by
default:

enx78e7d1ea46da

3. If the previous options do not apply, device is given a traditional name:

eth0 (first Ethernet device)
