traceroute can send UDP (the default), TCP (-T), or ICMP (-I) probes
   Firewall rules and router settings long the network path may block some
      or all of these
traceroute --mtu ...  # also report the MTUs
Some traceroute options (but not the defaults) require superuser privileges

tracepath and mtr are alternatives to traceroute that do not require superuser
   privileges
tracepath also reports the path MTU between endpoints

mtr -r -c # ... : run mtr in report mode rather than interactive curses (-t)
   mode
   -c # : number of traces to run before showing report and exiting
mtr -w ... : wide (don't truncate FQDNs in report to preset column width)
