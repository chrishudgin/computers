Not all hosts respond to broadcast pings even if they respond to pings to their
specific IP addresses.

An alternative to a ping loop in a script is to use nmap:

# nmap -sn -n network/maskbits

Example:

# nmap -sn -n 192.168.0.0/24

In older versions of nmap, use -sP instead of -sn; both mean "no port scan"
