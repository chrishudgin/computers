To send a gratuitous ARP from a server on its own behalf, use arping -A.

Example for a server whose IP address on eth0 is 10.0.0.45:

# arping -A -I eth0 10.0.0.45 -c 1
-A : send unsolicited (gratuitous) ARP REPLY
-I eth0 : host interface from which to obtain MAC address and send packet
-c 1 : count (number of packets to send)

All hosts in the same layer 2 broadcast domain as eth0 on the server will
receive the ARP REPLY packet  and will update their ARP caches to associate
10.0.0.45 with the MAC address of eth0 if they already had an entry in their
ARP caches for 10.0.0.45.  Hosts that did not already have an ARP cache entry
for 10.0.0.45 will not necessarily add one upon receiving a gratuitous ARP.

(Why -A and not -U?  "tcpdump -vv arp" will show MAC address in packet decode
when ARP REPLY packet is received, but not when ARP REQUEST packet is
received.  Add -e to the tcpdump command to see the MAC address either way.)

To display the ARP cache:

# ip n[eighbor] [show]
