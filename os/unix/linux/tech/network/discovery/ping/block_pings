One way to prevent a server from responding to ICMP echo request (ping) packets
is by creating a .conf file in /etc/sysctl.d with the line:

net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

followed by:

# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/somename.conf

or

# systemctl reboot

Alternatively:

From the firewalld.richlanguage(5) man page in the icmp-block section:
# firewall-cmd --permament --add-rich-rule='rule icmp-block name="echo-request"'
# firewall-cmd --reload

Note that the firewall-cmd solution will not block local ping packets, only
those originating on a remote host.  However, it has the advantage of being
more flexible, allowing (for example) pings to be blocked only on specific
network interfaces after they have been assigned to zones.
