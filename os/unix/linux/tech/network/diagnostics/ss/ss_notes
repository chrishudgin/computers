ss -tunap  # list all (-a) open TCP (-t) and UDP (-u) ports and connections
  with numeric (-n) port numbers and IP addresses
  including process information (-p), if any, for each open port or connection

Without -a, ss shows only active connections, not listening ports

With -l, ss shows only listening ports, not active connections

ss supports filter specifications like sport (source port), dport
   (destination port), and socket state along with boolean operators
   Example:
      ss state established
      ss state fin-wait-1

Some network ports are opened directly by the kernel instead of by a userland
process.  lsof will not list these ports because lsof is process-oriented.
Instead, use ss.

Example to show socket endpoints for established connections to/from
   TCP port 3260:

# ss -pont state established '( sport = :3260 or dport = :3260 )'
-p : show process using the socket (if any)
-o : include timer information (such as keepalive value in minutes)
-n : show port numbers rather than service names
-t : show TCP sockets only
sport : source (local) port
dport : destination (typically remote) port

Ports can also be selected for display by equality and inequality operators
