tcpdump  # capture all network traffic
tcpdump -i eth0 host foobox  # limit capture to eth0 and traffic to/from foobox
tcpdump -e  # show layer 2 traffic
tcpdump -X  # show contents of packets, not just packets descriptions
tcpdump -n  # numeric--don't resolve hostnames
tcpdump -nn  # numeric--don't resolve hostnames or port (service) names
tcpdump -tttt # include date in timestamps
tcpdump not port ssh  # exclude ssh traffic
tcpdump 'src host 10.0.10.11 and (tcp port 80 or icmp)'
tcpdump -w file  # save raw packet data to file
tcpdump -r file  # read saved raw packet data

tcpdump supports very precise filtering of packets, down to specific fields
   set to certain bit values within IP and TCP headers

tcpdump supports boolean operators (and, or, not), grouping of conditions
   within parentheses, mathematical relations (<, >, ==, !=), byte ranges [2:5],
   packet types ([icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echo), and bit shifting (<<, >>)
