ncat -l 1000  # listen on TCP port 1000 using all interfaces
ncat -u -l addr 1000
   listen to UDP port 1000 on specified address only
ncat [-p source port] [-s source addr] myserver 123
   start connection to TCP port 123 on myserver from a given source port/IP
ncat -e /some/cmd -l 8081 --keep-open  # execute command for each connection
   (remote end can then interact with command, albeit with an empty prompt)
ncat -z myserver 123
   test connection to TCP port 123 on myserver and exit immediately
   exit codes:
       0 = successful connection
       1 = unsuccessful connection
       2 = other errors unrelated to connection status

ncat can be used on both ends of a connection to test end-to-end network
   transport to a given port

A listening ncat process will serve data it reads from standard input

ncat can forward an ssh connection through a proxy

Example to test network speed between endpoints by sending 1 GB of zeroes:
node1 (receiver):
   $ nc -vvlp 12345 > /dev/null
node2 (transmitter):
   $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1048576 count=1024 | nc -vv <node1_hostname> 12345
