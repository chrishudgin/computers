nstat : display packet and connection statistics by protocol

nstat is the iproute2 package replacement for "netstat -s"

By default, nstat shows incremental changes to counters since previous
invocation of nstat, printing only the counters whose values have changed.

nstat -a : show absolute values of all counters.
