The xinetd "wait" option for a network service indicates whether xinetd itself
should accept multiple simultaneous connections to a service (using multiple
processes) (wait = no) or wait until the network service daemon has exited
before accepting a new connection (wait = yes).

The service daemon in question may accept multiple simultaneous connections to
itself even if xinetd does not accept multiple connections to that service's
port.

UDP services typically have wait = yes.  This prevents xinetd from spawning a
   new thread every time more UDP datagrams arrive.

TCP services typically have wait = no in order to accept new persistent
   connections (one per thread) while others are still being serviced.

Services of type INTERNAL (like discard, chargen, echo) are handled directly by
xinetd rather than by spawning an external daemon.
