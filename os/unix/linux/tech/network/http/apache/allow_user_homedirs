To allow Apache to serve content from user home directories on RHEL 7:

Comment out the following line from /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf:
UserDir disabled

Uncomment the following line from /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf:
UserDir public_html

# setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs on
# systemctl restart httpd

As <username>:
$ chmod 711 ~
$ mkdir ~/public_html
Add content to ~/public_html/index.html

User home directories will be accessible from:
http://<hostname>/~<username>/index.html
