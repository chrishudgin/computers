For port forwarding with firewalld to facilitate bidirectional traffic, IP
masquerading (which is really SNAT) may need to be activated as well.  This is
so that traffic being forwarded by the firewall will use the firewall's own IP
address, causing replies to be sent back to the firewall instead of to the
originating system (which will not be expecting traffic directly from the
replier--it will appear "unrelated" to an existing connection), since the
originating system may not be accessible directly from the replier (traffic
having to pass through the firewall system to reach it).
