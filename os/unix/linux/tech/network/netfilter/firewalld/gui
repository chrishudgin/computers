The firewalld GUI is firewall-config, provided by the firewall-config package.
The GUI can both show and change the runtime and permanent configurations,
including

zones
interfaces
services
ipsets
ports
protocols
sources
destinations
masquerading
forwarding
ICMP filtering

The GUI can also enable "panic mode", which immediately blocks all incoming
and outgoing IP traffic.
