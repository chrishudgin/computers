General information about firewalld zone concepts is in firewalld.zones(5).

Network interfaces and source addresses (of incoming traffic) can be bound to a
zone.  Any zone that has at least one network interface or source address bound
to it is an "active" zone.

By default, all zones permit all outgoing traffic and all incoming traffic that
is related to existing outgoing traffic.

Get names of all zones:
# firewall-cmd --get-zones
block dmz drop external home internal public trusted work

Get names of active zones:
# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

Get or set default zone (does not change existing interface assignments to
zones):
# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=<zonename>

Show zone configuration:
# firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
OR
# firewall-cmd --info-zone <zonename>
