The zone of a network interface is controlled by the ZONE parameter in the
interface's /etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-* file (e.g. ZONE=public).

If an interface is not assigned to any zone, the firewall rules of the default
zone will apply to it.

The loopback interface is a special case and is treated as a trusted interface
(all traffic coming from it is accepted).

List interfaces in a given zone (default zone if none specified):
# firewall-cmd [--zone=<zonename>] --list-interfaces
eth0 eth1

Persistently change zone assigned to interface, removing it from any other zone:
# firewall-cmd --zone=<zonename> --change-interface=<ifname>
Example:
   # firewall-cmd --zone=dmz --change-interface=eth1
