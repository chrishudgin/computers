Goal: Pass HTTP traffic through firewall at 10.0.0.224:80 to 10.0.0.93:8080

Ensure that the HTTP server is able to process HTTP requests on port 8080
from itself:
# nc 10.0.0.93 8080

This may require adjusting iptables rules to close port 80 and open port 8080:
# iptables -t filter -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

Ensure IPv4 forwarding is enabled on the firewall machine, 10.0.0.224:
# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
1

On the firewall machine (10.0.0.224):

Perform DNAT on incoming packets from other hosts so that they will specify the
new destination:
# iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d 10.0.0.224 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.93:8080

Allow the packets to be forwarded by the filter table after it has been DNAT-ed:
# iptables -t filter -I FORWARD -d 10.0.0.93 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

Perform SNAT on traffic leaving the firewall for the HTTP server so that the
HTTP server will send its responses back to the firewall instead of to the
original client's address (which is not translated by DNAT):
# iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -p tcp -d 10.0.0.93 --dport 8080 -j SNAT --to-source 10.0.0.224

The SNAT is necessary because if the HTTP server responds to the client
directly, the client will see packets coming from a different server (the HTTP
server) than the server to which it thought it sent the request (the firewall)
and will ignore those packets.

Perform DNAT on packets originating on the firewall and destined for the HTTP
server:
# iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -d 10.0.0.224 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.93:8080

This DNAT in the OUTPUT chain is necessary because packets originating on the
local host (the firewall machine in this case) do not traverse the PREROUTING
chain, but they do traverse the OUTPUT chain.

*****

Packets originating on hosts other than the firewall machine and destined for
port 80 will traverse the following chains, in order:

PREROUTING (nat table)
FORWARD (filter table)
POSTROUTING (nat table)

Packets originating from the firewall itself and addressed to port 80 will
traverse the following chains, in order:

OUTPUT (nat table)
OUTPUT (filter table)
POSTROUTING (nat table)

*****

The firewall transparently allows responses to DNAT-ed and SNAT-ed requests to
be sent through the firewall to the original client systems.  No additional
explicit rules are needed to de-NAT the reponse packets, as this is done
automatically by netfilter.
