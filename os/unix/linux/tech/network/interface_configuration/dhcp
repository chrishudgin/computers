Configure an interface with a single dynamic IP address, default gateway, and
DNS resolver configuration through DHCP:

# dhclient eth0

Release the current DHCP lease, remove the leased IP address from an
interface, and remove associated routing table entries if they can no longer
be used:

# dhclient -r eth0
