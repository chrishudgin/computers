Documentation for all configuration files in and below /etc/sysconfig,
   including network configuration scripts and files in
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts like ifup, ifdown and ifcfg-*, can be found in
   /usr/share/doc/initscripts-*/sysconfig.txt

BOOTPROTO=none and BOOTPROTO=static are equivalent (anything other than
   "bootp" or "dhcp" means "none")
It is possible to configure an interface to use both DHCP and a static IP
address by setting BOOTPROTO=dhcp and also including an IPADDR and PREFIX 
value in the same ifcfg file.

HWADDR matches the hardware MAC address of the interface
MACADDR sets the MAC address of the interface (do not use with HWADDR)

To set multiple static IP addresses on an interface, use:

IPADDR0=
PREFIX0=
GATEWAY0=
IPADDR1= 
PREFIX1=
IPADDR2=
PREFIX2=
etc.

with appropriate values.

PEERDNS allows /etc/resolv.conf to be overwritten by static network info during
network startup using DNS1, DNS2 values in ifcfg-* files.  Defaults to yes, but
has no effect in a static IP configuration if neither DNS1 nor DNS2 are set.
/etc/resolv.conf can also be (and usually is) overwritten by dhclient when it
configures an interface for DHCP, and by NetworkManager if it is enabled.

ZONE sets firewall zone for the interface (for example, "public")

ETHTOOL_OPTS (deprecated) sets arguments to ethtool for the interface, such
   as speed, duplex, and autonegotiation
   udev rules are the preferred way to set these options at boot

ipcalc calculates network parameters like network, prefix, netmask,
   and/or broadcast address given the necessary information like IP address in
   CIDR notation

ifup-post calls ifup-routes and ifup-aliases

route-* content should no longer be in the following format: 11.0.0.0/8 via 11.0.0.0.1 dev eth0
Instead, use:
ADDRESS#=
NETMASK#=
GATEWAY#=
with # being an optional integer >= 0
