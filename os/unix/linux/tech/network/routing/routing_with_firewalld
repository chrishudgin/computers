Route between two networks without NAT or masquerading when firewalld is
running on the router, and the router has (for example) network interfaces eth0
and eth1 with IP addresses 192.168.4.213 and 192.168.10.10 on networks
192.168.4.0/24 and 192.168.10.0/24, respectively:

On systems attached to networks on either side of the router, update the
routing table both in the persistent and active configuration.  For example,
on a system (other than the router itself) with eth0 on the 192.168.4.0/24
network, create a file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0 with the
following entry:
192.168.10.0/24 via 192.168.4.213 dev eth0
and then run:
# ip route add 192.168.10.0/24 via 192.168.4.213 dev eth0

On the router, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
and run:
# sysctl -p

On the router, configure the firewall to allow unlimited traffic between
interfaces, or add limits on ports, destinations, etc. as desired:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i eth0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT
# firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter FORWARD 0 -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
# firewall-cmd --reload
