For statically-defined network configuration, the default route is defined as
follows, in order of highest to lowest precedence:

A "default" statement in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-<ifname>, if
present.
Example:
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0
default via 10.0.0.1 dev eth0

The GATEWAY directive in /etc/sysconfig/network, if set there.
This method is deprecated in RHEL 7.
Example:
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network
GATEWAY=10.0.0.1

The first GATEWAY directive set in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
files (which are processed in numerically ascending order) for interfaces that
are up and for which DEFROUTE=yes:
Example:
# egrep -H 'DEFROUTE|GATEWAY' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:DEFROUTE=yes
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:GATEWAY=192.168.122.1
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1:DEFROUTE=yes
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1:GATEWAY=192.168.2.1
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2:DEFROUTE=no
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth2:GATEWAY=10.0.0.1
(192.168.122.1 would be the default gateway in this case, if it had not been set
 globally or in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth[012])

In the above example, the routing table would show two default routes, the
first via 192.168.122.1 and the second via 192.168.2.1, which is probably not
desirable.  The first default route in the table would take precedence.

*****

On some operating systems, the default router does not necessarily have to be
on a subnet on which the host has an interface, but it does have to be on a
subnet to which the host has a non-default route defined.  For example, a host
on the 192.168.0.0/24 network could have a default router 10.0.0.1 on the
10.0.0.0/8 subnet, as long as there is an entry in the host's routing table
with a specified route to the 10.0.0.0/8 network.

On Linux, an indirect route to a default gateway is not allowed; the default
gateway must be on a subnet that is local to the host.
