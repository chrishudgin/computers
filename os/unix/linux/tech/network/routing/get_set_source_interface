To get the source network interface and source network address that would
be used when sending traffic to a remote destination:

# ip route get <ipaddr>    (Can't use hostname, only IP address)

Example:

# ip route get 23.60.11.32
23.60.11.32 via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0  src 192.168.0.104 
    cache  mtu 1500 advmss 1460 hoplimit 64

If there are multiple interfaces or IP addresses on the same network, the first
IP address or parent interface (in the case of alias interfaces) is used by
default as the source for outgoing packets.

To change this after the interfaces and IP addresses have been brought up:

# ip route change 10.0.0.0/8 dev eth0 src 10.0.0.140

Alternatively, set an iptables source NAT (SNAT) rule in POSTROUTING, such as:
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 10.0.0.140

Note:  Setting SRCADDR in an ifcfg-* file with multiple IP addresses does NOT
   accomplish the same thing!
