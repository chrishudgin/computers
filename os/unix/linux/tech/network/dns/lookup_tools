nslookup is deprecated

The "host" command uses the local resolver and /etc/resolv.conf
   (but not /etc/hosts)
host hostname [server]
host -a hostname  # Set query type to "ANY"

dig [@server] [+search] hostname type  # type can by ANY, A, MX, etc.
dig [@server] [+search] -x 10.0.0.42  # -x required for reverse lookup
By default, dig does not append domain names in the "search" list in
   /etc/resolv.conf.  To use the "search" list from resolv.conf, use +search
dig +trace hostname  # trace name resolution delegation through DNS nameserver
   hierarchy
