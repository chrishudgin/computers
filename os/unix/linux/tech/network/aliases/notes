Add an IP address to an existing interface eth0:

ip address add 10.0.0.194/8 label eth0:1 dev eth0

The "label eth0:1" is optional, but including it allows the alias to be seen
   by ifconfig.

To make the alias permanent, create a file
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1
with an entry for DEVICE=eth0:1 and other fields as normal

Only fields whose values differ from those in the parent device config file
   (like IPADDR) must be included int the alias's configuration file
