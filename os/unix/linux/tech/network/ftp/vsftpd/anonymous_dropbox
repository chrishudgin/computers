Note: In the example below, a "dropbox" is a directory ("uploads" in the example
below) in which anonymous users can upload files but cannot read directory
contents or files.  To constrain the directory size, quotas should be used,
or the uploads directory should be placed on a dedicated volume.

1. Configure /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf:

Enable writes:
write_enable=YES

Enable anonymous ftp:
anonymous_enable=YES

Enable writes by anonymous user:
anon_upload_enable=YES

Set uploads by anonymous to be owned by root for security reeasons:
chown_uploads=YES
chown_username=root

Optionally, allow the anonymous user to create directories:
anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES

2. Create a directory under the FTP root dir (which defaults to /var/ftp):

# mkdir -p /var/ftp/uploads
# chown root:ftp /var/ftp/pub/uploads
# chmod 730 /var/ftp/pub/uploads
# semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t '/var/ftp/uploads(/.*)?'
# restorecon -FRv /var/ftp/uploads

3. Set SELinux booleans to allow anonymous ftp writes:

# setsebool -P ftpd_anon_write on

4. Restart vsftpd:

# systemctl restart vsftpd
