Create a loopback device:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/imgfile bs=1M count=8
# losetup -f --show /root/imgfile
-f : Use next available loop device (/dev/loop0, /dev/loop1, etc.)
--show : show device name
# fdisk /dev/loop0  (create a partition, etc.)
# partprobe /dev/loop0
# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/loop0p1  (note partition name is "loop0p1", not "loop01")
# mount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt

Mount an existing filesystem contained in a file:

# mount -o loop /root/imgfile /mnt
When a loopback filesystem is mounted in this way, the next available loopback
device is selected automatically, and that loopback device (though not the
backing file) is automatically removed when the filesystem is unmounted.

Remove a loopback device:

# umount /mnt
# fdisk /dev/loop0  (remove all partitions)
# partprobe /dev/loop0  (notify kernel that partitions have been removed;
   otherwise, /sys/block/loop0/loop0p1, etc. will remain, causing I/O
   errors when block devices are scanned, e.g. with pvscan)
# losetup -d /dev/loop0
-d : detach (disassociate loop device with backing file;
   backing file itself is not deleted)
   /sys/block/loop0 will remain, but will not be active (no /dev/loop0)
# rm /root/imgfile

Show loopback devices:

# losetup
