loopback devices can be used as though they were simple "disk" devices,
   partitioned and with entries in /dev (loop0p1, loop1p3, etc.).

Partitioned loopback devices can optionally be used with device mapper by running kpartx on them:

# kpartx -a /dev/loop0  (adds loop0p1, etc. to /dev/mapper)
# kpartx -d /dev/loop0  (removes loop0p1, etc. from /dev/mapper)

*****

To configure as a loopback device, and then mount, a file (such as an ISO file)
that already contains a filesystem, in a single step:

# mount -o loop /some/file.iso /media

Unmounting a loopback filesystem that was mounted in this specific way will
also automatically delete the loopback device (e.g. /dev/loop0) that was
created for it.
