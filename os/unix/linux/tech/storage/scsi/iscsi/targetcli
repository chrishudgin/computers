targetcli [commands]

Within the targetcli shell:
help [command]

The commands available (including help on them) depend on the current path.

A value for an argument can be specified using the syntax argname=value using
the argument name given in the help statement for the command.
Example:  create ... various lun parameters ... write_back=false

Tab completion is available.

Changes take effect immediately but must be saved with "saveconfig" to be
persistent.

To navigate the tree of "configuration nodes" interactively in the targetcli
shell, type "cd" without any arguments and use arrow keys to select a path.

To get and set options (either globally or for the object in the current path),
use the "get" and "set" commands.

To show existing sessions (logins), use the "sessions detail" command.

Overview of steps to set up a new iSCSI target in targetcli:

1. Create backstore (file or block device).

Creating a backstore of type fileio will also create the backing file itself
in the specified Linux directory and with the specified size.  You must set
desired ownership and permissions on the file outside of targetcli.

2. Create a target that will make the backstores visible through iSCSI.

3. Configure portals (IP address and port) through which the target will be
visible.  Default is port 3260 on all IP addresses (0.0.0.0), but the default
portal can be deleted and replaced with more specific portals.

4. Create iSCSI LUNs that map to the backstores.  These associate a logical unit
number for each LUN with the backing store.

5. Create ACLs to limit access to a target to a specified initiator ID or IDs.
In RHEL 7, iSCSI initiator ID is in /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi

6. Save the configuration.
