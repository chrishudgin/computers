Multiple mount points can be specified relative to each other using the
multi-mounts syntax in an indirect map file, as in the following example:

server	-rw,hard,intr	/ -ro myserver.me.org:/ \
			/usr myserver.me.org:/usr \
			/home myserver.me.org:/home

In this example, the autofs client would mount:

/some/path/server	from	myserver.me.org:/
/some/path/server/usr	from	myserver.me.org:/usr
/some/path/server/home	from	myserver.me.org:/home
