With NFS4, all shares exported from a server that a client is permitted to
mount can be mounted with a single command under a single mount point by
mounting the "pseudo-root" filesystem of the NFS server.  (The actual root
filesystem of the NFS server does not need to be shared.)

Example:

If server1 shares /share1 and /share2 to a given client:

# mount server1:/ /mnt  (pseudo-root mount)

# ls -l /mnt
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 22 Jul 26 10:49 share1
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 19 Jul 25 21:06 share2

# df -h /mnt/share{1,2}
Filesystem       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
server1:/mynfs1   97M  5.3M   92M   6% /mnt/share1
server1:/mynfs2   97M  5.3M   92M   6% /mnt/share2

This works even if "showmount -e server1" fails due to firewall rules (e.g.
ports for rpc-bind, mountd, and nfs services blocked on server1).
