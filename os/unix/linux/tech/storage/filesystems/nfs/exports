Directories to export are read from the files:
   /etc/exports
   /etc/exports.d/*.exports

The syntax of an export line in these files is as follows:

/dir/to/export [-option1,option2,...] client1(option3,option4,...) [...] [\]
   [...]

where:
   options are export options, not client mount options
   each listed client may be:
      a single host (hostname or IP address)
      a set of hosts using wildcards *, ? and [character class]
        in hostname or domain elements; an example character class is [0-9]
      an IP subnet using "slash" ( / ) notation for netmask, e.g. 192.168.2.0/24
      the * character, matching any client

By default:
   exports are read-only (ro)
   I/O to read/write (rw) exports is synchronous (sync)
   the root user on the client is mapped to the user nfsnobody (root_squash)
   write commits are delayed to allow for I/O batching (wdelay)

Reference: exports(5)

After making changes to these files, re-read and apply the export configuration
with:
# exportfs -r

*****

Stop all NFS exports temporarily without modifying /etc/exports or
/etc/exports.d/*.exports and without bouncing the NFS server daemons:
# exportfs -ua

*****

The crossmnt export option when specified on a filesystem with children allows
a client to mount the child filesystems of an exported parent automatically and
transparently when the child filesystem's files or directories are accessed.

*****

The "mountpoint" or "mp" export option ensures that the export directory is a
filesystem mount point on the server before it can be mounted anywhere on a
client.  This option protects against sharing a directory that is intended to
be a filesystem mount point when the filesystem is not actually mounted.  This
option is not enabled by default.

*****

The "security_label" export option allows an NFS client to modify the SELinux
security labels of files and directories in the exported directory or
filesystem.  To be effective, this option also requires the client to mount the
exported filesystem with NFS version 4.2.

*****

Show current list of exports and their mount options in format suitable for use
in file /etc/exports:

# exportfs -s
/mynfs1  tester1.example.com(rw,sync,wdelay,hide,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,secure,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
/mynfs2  tester1.example.com(rw,sync,wdelay,hide,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash)
/mynfs3  tester1.example.com(rw,sync,wdelay,hide,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,secure,root_squash,all_squash)
/export/home  *(rw,sync,wdelay,hide,no_subtree_check,sec=sys,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash)

This command reports much more detail than "showmount -e".
