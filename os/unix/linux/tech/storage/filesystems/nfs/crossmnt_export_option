The crossmnt export option when specified on a filesystem with children allows
a client to mount the child filesystems of the exported parent automatically
and transparently when the child filesystem's files or directories are
accessed from the client.

On RHEL 6 and earlier, a filesystem implicitly mounted from a client through a
parent filesystem exported with crossmnt will not appear in the output of df or
in /etc/mtab but will still appear in the file /proc/mounts.

Explicit mounts of child filesystems are still possible if desired, with or
without the crossmnt export option being set on the parent filesystem.
However, if the crossmnt export option is not set for the parent, the child
filesystems must be exported explicitly in order for clients to access them.

Example:

On NFS server, local filesystem /share1/extra is mounted below local filesystem
/share1.

On NFS server rhel5host running RHEL 5:
# cat /etc/exports
/share1        *(rw,crossmnt,fsid=0)
/share1/extra  *(rw)
# On RHEL 5, explicit export of /share1/extra is needed
# for a client to access it

On NFS server rhel6or7host running RHEL 6 or 7:
# cat /etc/exports
/share1        *(rw,crossmnt)
# On RHEL 6 or 7, an explicit export of /share1/extra is NOT needed with
# crossmnt export option set on export /share1

Start NFS sharing as usual.

On NFS client of rhel5host:
# mount -t nfs4 rhel5host:/ /share1
   # Actually mounts server's /share1, not server's /
   # Also makes /share1/extra filesystem available to client,
   # even though it is not explicitly mounted on the client,
   # because /share1 was exported with the crossmnt option.
   # Note that /share1/extra must still be explicitly exported from server.
$ ls -l /share1/extra   # shows contents of server fs /share1/extra
                        # even though it's not explicitly mounted on client

On NFS client of rhel6or7host:
# mount -t nfs4 rhel6or7host:/share1 /share1
   # Also makes /share1/extra filesystem available to client,
   # even though it is not explicitly mounted on the client,
   # because /share1 was exported with the crossmnt option.
$ ls -l /share1/extra   # shows contents of server fs /share1/extra
                        # even though it's not explicitly mounted on client

*****

"crossmnt" versus "nohide":

The "nohide" export option allows a client to access a child filesystem
transparently, without an explicit mount of the child filesystem, as long as
the parent and child are both exported from the server and the parent is
mounted on the client.  What the "crossmnt" export option does is make the
export of child filesystems *automatic* when their parent is explicitly
exported.

The "nohide" behavior is inherent in NFSv4, even if the "hide" export option is
specified.
