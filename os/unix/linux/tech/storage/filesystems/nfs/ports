PORTS

NFS services use RPC to register their ports, as follows:

Server ports:
nfs : 2049/tcp and 2049/udp
mountd : 20048/tcp and 20048/udp (RHEL 7)
         ephemeral port randomly selected at daemon startup (RHEL 6 and earlier)

Client ports:
status :  ephemeral port randomly selected at daemon startup
nlockmgr : ephemeral port randomly selected at daemon startup

Fixed ports can be assigned if necessary (for example, to facilitate simplified
firewall traversal) in /etc/sysconfig/nfs (RHEL 5, 6, 7) or /etc/nfs.conf (RHEL
7).

Ports registered with RPC for NFS and other active services can be viewed with:
$ rpcinfo -p [hostname]
