The NFS versions supported by a particular running Linux kernel can be determined as in this example:

$ cat /proc/fs/nfsd/versions
-2 +3 +4 +4.1 +4.2

This example output indicates that NFS version 2 is not supported while NFS
versions 3 through 4.2 are supported.

The versions supported by the NFS server daemon rpc.nfsd can further be
configured in /etc/nfs.conf, as for example with the variables:

#[nfsd]
# vers2=n
# vers3=y
# vers4=y
# vers4.0=y
# vers4.1=y
# vers4.2=y
