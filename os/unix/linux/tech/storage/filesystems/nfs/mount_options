Force the mount to use a specified version of NFS instead of the highest
possible version supported by both the server and client:
# mount -o nfsvers=<version> ...

The NFS version (e.g. vers=4.1) used for a given mount can be found in the list
of mount options shown by the "mount" command with no arguments.

Show a complete list of all mount options in use for all NFS mounts:
# nfsstat -m
