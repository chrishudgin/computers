RHEL 7 NFS SERVERS

SERVER SYSTEMD UNITS AND DAEMONS

The following systemd units must be running or active on the NFS server:
The NFS client services, plus:
# systemctl enable nfs-server
# systemctl start nfs-server

nfs-server.service starts:
   nfs-idmapd.service (pulled in as dependency)
   rpc.mountd (pulled in as dependency)
   rpc.nfsd

Kerberos

On a server sharing Kerberized NFS shares, the Kerberos services must be
configured and started:
# systemctl start krb5kdc.service
# systemctl start kadmin.service

In addition, the nfs-secure-server and nfs-secure services must be
started (requiring /etc/krb5.keytab to be set up beforehand):
# systemctl start nfs-secure.service
# systemctl start nfs-secure-server.service
nfs-secure.service starts rpc.gssd.

*****

RHEL 5 and 6 NFS SERVERS

SERVER SERVICES AND DAEMONS

The following services must be running on the NFS server:
portmap (RHEL 5)
rpcbind (RHEL 6)
nfslock
nfs (the actual NFS server processes)

# chkconfig portmap on (RHEL 5)
# chkconfig rpcbind on (RHEL 6)
# chkconfig nfslock on
# chkconfig nfs on
# service portmap start (RHEL 5)
# service rpcbind start (RHEL 6)
# service nfslock start
# service nfs start

The "nfs" service starts:
rpc.rquotad
rpc.mountd
lockd
nfsd
rpc.idmapd

*****

RHEL 7 NFS CLIENTS

The following systemd units must be running or active on an NFS client:
# systemctl is-active nfs-client.target  (verify active)

nfs-client.target pulls in (directly or indirectly):
   rpcbind.service (rpcbind daemon)
   gssproxy.service (gssproxy daemon)
   rpc-statd.service (rpc.statd daemon)

Kerberos

For a client of Kerberized NFS shares, the nfs-secure service must be started
(requiring /etc/krb5.keytab to be set up beforehand):
# systemctl start nfs-secure.service

nfs-secure.service starts
   rpc-gssd.service (rpc.gssd daemon)

*****

RHEL 5 and 6 NFS CLIENTS

The RHEL 5 and RHEL 6 NFS clients default to mounting NFS filesystems with NFS
protocol version 3 (NFSv3) even if the NFS server also offers protocol version
4 (NFSv4).  To specify an NFSv4 mount, use the "mount.nfs4" command or specify
"-t nfs4" on the "mount" command line.

The following services must be running on an NFS client:

portmap (RHEL 5)
rpcbind (RHEL 6)
nfslock for NFSv3 and earlier (runs rpc.statd continuously and lockd on demand)
