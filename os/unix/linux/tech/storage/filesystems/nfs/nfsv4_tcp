NFS version 4 uses TCP (not UDP) as its transport mechanism.  All NFSv4 servers
must support TCP for NFS transport.

By default, the NFSv4 client does not need to contact rpcbind on a remote NFS
server to obtain an NFS port number.  Instead, the NFSv4 client by default will
contact the remote server on port 2049/tcp.

*****

Determine whether <hostname>, if reachable, is using NFSv4 protocol over TCP
for sharing:

# rpcinfo -T tcp <hostname> nfs 4

program 100003 version 4 ready and waiting  # service is available

OR

rpcinfo: RPC: Program not registered  # service is not available

OR

rpcinfo: RPC: Program/version mismatch; low version = 3, high version = 4
program 100003 version 1 is not available  # available at different version
