Security mount options for NFS are, by increasing level:

sec=
   none : equivalent to all_squash (see below)
   sys (the default) : permissions on files are based on UID/GID.
   krb5 : user authentication done through Kerberos, file access as with sys
   krb5i : krb5 plus integrity checking of transferred data
   krb5p : krb5i plus encryption of transferred data

The highest security setting on either end of the connection (server or client)
represents the minimum level permitted for the mount, unless more than one
security setting is designated in the mount options (see paragraph below).

To designate more than one allowable security mount option, separate by colons
the security mount options that are to be permitted, as in this example:
# mount -o sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p server1:/share /mnt

If the NFS share is exported with the all_squash option, all UIDs/GIDs are
effectively mapped to nfsnobody:nfsnobody, access is permitted on a file or dir
only if user or group nfsnobody has that permission, and only root can remove a
file from a directory of mode 1777.

If mounting different shares from the same server that require different
security mount options, specify each security mount option explicitly when
mounting rather than relying on the default (sec=sys) to take effect
automatically.

On RHEL 7, the nfs-secure systemd service must be running in order for any of
the Kerberos security mount options to be usable.
