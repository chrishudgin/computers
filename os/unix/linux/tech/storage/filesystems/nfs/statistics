nfsstat(8) shows NFS server and client statistics, including operation counts
by NFS protocol version.

# nfsstat [-s|-c] [-l] [-Z[interval]] ...
   -s : limit to server-side statistics
   -c : limit to client-side statistics
   -l : format output as a list for easier parsing, instead of as a table;
        cannot be used with -Z (see below)
   -Z : display new statistics from time command started (break with Ctrl-C),
        or at interval in seconds; no output for interval if no NFS operations
        occurred; do not add whitespace between -Z and interval value

# nfsstat -m : show all mount options for mounted NFS filesystems
