NFS FILE LOCKING

The rpc.statd daemon on the NFS server and client communicate lock status with
each other.  If either node reboots, it attempts to notify the other node.  The
server clears the client's locks whenever the client reboots.  When the server
reboots, all clients must subsequently send their lock information back to the
server.  Clients maintain locks and server names persistently on stable
storage.

Each reboot increment's an NFS client or server's NSM (network status monitor)
state number so that clients and servers can distinguish lock requests
following a reboot from those that preceded it.

NFSv3:

File locking is managed by the lockd daemon, which is started and stopped
automatically as NFSv3 filesystems are mounted and unmounted.

lockd is monitored and managed by rpc.statd.  lockd cannot be started, stopped,
or killed outside of the control of rpc.statd and the NFSv3 mounting/unmounting
process.

NFSv4:

File locking is integrated into the NFSv4 protocol and does not use
the NLM sideband protocol or the lockd daemon.

*****

Caution: NFS does not provide strict file locking semantics, especially among
multiple clients.  For strict file locking semantics, applications should
serialize their accesses of any given file.
