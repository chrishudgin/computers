RHEL 7 NFS SERVERS

FIREWALLD

The following firewalld services must be open on the NFS server:

To allow clients to mount an NFS filesystem exported from the server:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs3 (if NFSv3 exports are used)
# firewall-cmd --reload

To allow clients to get a list of exports from the server:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd
# firewall-cmd --reload

RHEL 5 and 6 NFS SERVERS

IPTABLES

To allow NFSv4 traffic through a firewall, it is sufficient to add a single
rule to /etc/sysconfig/iptables before the final REJECT or DROP rules:

For RHEL 5:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 2049 -j ACCEPT

For RHEL 6:

-A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 2049 -j ACCEPT

To allow NFSv3 traffic through a firewall, NFS services must be configured to
use fixed (rather than randomly assigned) ports, and a number of firewall rules
must be created.
