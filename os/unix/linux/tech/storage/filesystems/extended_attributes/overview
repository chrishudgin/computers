Reference: attr(5)

Extended attribute tools are provided by the attr package.

Extended attributes are arbitrary name-value pairs associated with a file or
directory.

Extended attributes are supported on ext2/3/4 and XFS filesystems. 

There are four classes of extended attributes, each of which forms a namespace:
   security
   system
   trusted
   user

   SELinux uses the "security" class to store a file's context.
   POSIX ACLS and Capabilities use the "system" class to store their data.

By default, getattr shows only attributes in the "user" class.

In order for ext2/3/4 filesystems to support extended attributes in the "user"
class, they must be mounted with the user_xattr mount option, which is the
default.
