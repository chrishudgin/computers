"/dev/root" and "rootfs" appearing in the output of df as the devices for the
root filesystem can be caused by /etc/mtab being a symlink to
/proc/self/mounts.  Removing the symlink resolves this problem.

Before:

# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
rootfs                 15G  2.9G   11G  21% /
/dev/root              15G  2.9G   11G  21% /
...

# ls -l /etc/mtab
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 Apr  9 13:24 /etc/mtab -> /proc/self/mounts

Fix:

# rm /etc/mtab
# shutdown -r now

After:

# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda2              15G  2.9G   11G  21% /
...

# ls -l /etc/mtab
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 325 Apr  9 13:32 /etc/mtab
