Force unmount and lazy unmount:

# umount [-f] [-l] <mount_point>

   -f : force unmount
        This option is intended to be used on hung NFS filesystems;
           it does not kill processes that are using the filesystem
           and therefore will not succeed if processes are still using
           the filesystem.

   -l : lazy unmount--remove mount from filesystem tree immediately, even
        if some processes are still accessing the (possibly hung) filesystem.

Any processes that were using a non-hung filesystem unmounted with a lazy
unmount will remain running.

Any processes that were using a hung filesystem will remain hung unless they
are terminated, or until access to the filesystem is restored (but the
filesystem will remain unmounted until mounted again by an administrator).

No new processes will hang when attempting to access the filesystem's mount
point directory, which is no longer an active mount point since the filesystem
was unmounted.
