The fsck.xfs program is a stub which does nothing and always returns with a
successful status.  xfs_repair now performs filesystem checking and repair for
XFS.  Checking of an XFS filesystem is done automatically when it is mounted.

Thus, the fsck_pass field in /etc/fstab is not useful for XFS filesystems.  If
it is set to 0, fsck.xfs is not run; if it is set to a non-zero value, fsck.xfs
is run but does nothing and always exits successfully.
