# mkfs.xfs -L <somelabel> /dev/sdb1

After creation of the filesystem (with filesystem unmounted):
# xfs_admin -L <somelabel> /dev/sdb1

After creation of the filesystem (with filesystem mounted):
# xfs_io -c "label -s <somelabel>" /myfs1

Display the label:
# blkid -o value -s LABEL /dev/sdb1

Remove the label (with filesystem mounted):
# xfs_io -c "label -c" /myfs1

Remove the label (with filesystem unmounted):
# xfs_admin -L '--' /dev/sdb1
