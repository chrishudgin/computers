Check whether an ext filesystem's "clean" flag is set:

# dumpe2fs -h /dev/sda2 2>/dev/null | grep "Filesystem state"
Filesystem state:	clean

Other possible states are:

Filesystem state:	not clean
Filesystem state:	not clean with errors

However, an ext filesystem that is marked clean may not necessarily be
error-free and may be flagged as needing a fsck after it is mounted and I/O has
occurred.  More information on the limitations of relying on the "clean" flag
