CIFS filesystems can be mounted with username/password authentication if the
SMB server is configured accordingly.  For example:

# mount -t cifs -o username=joe,password=FooBar //server1/data /mnt

To avoid having to put username and password credentials into a process command
string or into the world-readable /etc/fstab, use the CIFS mount option
"credentials" instead, as in this example:

# mount -t cifs -o credentials=/etc/smb.cred //server1/data /mnt

where the credentials file is readable only by root or by the user connecting
to the SMB share and contains the share's username and password in plain text
as follows:

username=someuser
password=somepassword
domain=somedomain    (this line is needed only if a domain is applicable)
