The order of entries in /etc/fstab matters, since mounts are performed
sequentially according to their order in the file regardless of the
hierarchical relationships of their mount points.

Thus, placing an entry for /foo/bar ahead of an entry for /foo in /etc/fstab
would be incorrect.

The mount option keyword "defaults" sets the following mount options:
rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async
