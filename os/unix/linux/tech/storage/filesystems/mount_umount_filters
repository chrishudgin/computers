Filter the list of filesystems to be mounted or unmounted by filesystem type:

# mount -a [-v] -t [no]type1,type2,...
# umount -a [-v] -t [no]type1,type2,...
   -v : verbose

If "no" is prepended to the first type in the list, it negates all types in the
list.

Filter the list of filesystems by mount by mount options listed in /etc/fstab:

# mount -a [-v] -O [no]option1,[no]option2,...

Filter the list of filesystems to mount by mount options currently active
for the filesystem (regardless of /etc/fstab contents, despite what man page
says):

# umount -a [-v] -O [no]option1,[no]option2,...



Only mounts matching all specified types/options pass the filter.

Caution!  For both mount and umount, if "no" is prepended to a -O option, it
does not match a filesystem "no... " mount option but rather eliminates
(negates) all matches FOR that option.

For example, if /mnt is mounted with the noatime option:
# umount -a -O noatime
does NOT unmount /mnt but DOES unmount all filesystems that do not show the
mount option "atime" in their explicit mount options.
