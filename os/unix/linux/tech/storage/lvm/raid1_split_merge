To split a data sub-LV (a mirror component) from a raid1 LV:

(Before the split, lv_raid1 has sub-LVs lv_raid1_rimage_0 and lv_raid1_rimage_1)
# lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 [--trackchanges] /dev/vg02/lv_raid1

--trackchanges keeps a log of changed blocks so that only changed blocks will
be resynced upon a later merge.

The split mirror sub-LV is read-only but can be mounted:

# mount -o nouuid /dev/vg02/lv_raid1_rimage_1 /mnt

To merge the split mirror LV into the original raid1 LV:

# umount /mnt
# lvconvert --mergemirrors lv_raid1_rimage_1

*****

To split a raid1 sub-LV into a new LV, which cannot be merged back into the
original:

# lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 -n lv_raid1_split /dev/vg03/lv_raid1
