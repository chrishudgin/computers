Extent ranges on a PV (as in an lvcreate command) can be specified as PV[:PE-PE]

Example for placing a logical volume in a given set of extents:

# lvcreate --type linear -l 48 -n mylv vg02 /dev/sdb1:0-47

Example for relocating extents within a PV or to a given location on a
different PV:

# pvmove --alloc anywhere /dev/sdb1:0-24 /dev/sdb1:100-124

The extents will be moved regardless of which PEs are in use by which LVs (so
LVs could end up with discontinuous PE ranges), but the target PEs must not
already be in use by LVs or the pvmove command will abort without taking action.

Discontinuous PE ranges can be coalesced with a pvmove to another PV using
the default ("normal") allocation policy which prefers to allocate PEs
sequentially by LV.

The physical extents selected for a pvmove can be restricted to those used by
a single logical volume, leaving PEs used by other LVs in place:

# pvmove -n lvol1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
