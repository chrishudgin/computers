By default, volumes are activated with activation mode of "degraded", meaning
RAID volumes with redundancy will be activated if redundant PVs are missing,
but any volumes with missing non-redundant PVs will not be activated.

To force activation of volumes with missing non-redundant PVs, use
"--activationmode partial" with activation commands vgchange -ay
and lvchange -ay.
