If a PV in a RAID LV is suspected to have been corrupted while the RAID LV was
offline, keep the LV offline and rebuild the data on the PV:

# lvchange --rebuild /dev/sdn1 /dev/vg05/lv_raid1

This forces all data to be copied back to the specified PV.

Then bring the LV online and mount it:

# lvchange -ay /dev/vg05/lv_raid1
# mount /dev/vg05/lv_raid1 /appl
