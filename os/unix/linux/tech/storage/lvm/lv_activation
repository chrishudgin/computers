lvchange|vgchange -a y|n|ay

LV activation can be commanded with lvchange and vgchange with the "-a y"
(manual activation) or "-a ay" (auto activation) options. In the case of auto
activation, any LV is activated by default unless the lvm.conf setting
activation/auto_activation_volume_list has been set, in which case only LVs
that match entries in the auto_activation_volume_list will be auto activated.
Manual activation (-a y) ignores this setting and proceeds with LV activation
unconditionally.
