To bring a temporarily absent disk back online in a VG if it is not brought
back automatically as it should be:

# vgextend --restoremissing vg01 /dev/sdd1  (/dev/sdd1 must be the device that
   was missing, and it must now be available with the same name as before)

To trigger a resync of a RAID LV after a transient disk failure
(disk is back online):

# lvchange --refresh /dev/vg02/lv01
