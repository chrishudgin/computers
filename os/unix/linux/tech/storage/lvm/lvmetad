The lvmetad daemon is started by the static lvm2-lvmetad.service unit if
use_lvmetad=1 in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf.  In RHEL 7, use_lvmetad=1 is set by
default.

The use of lvmetad is optional.  It has two purposes--performance enhancement
by caching LVM metadata in memory (instead of scanning all disks for LVM
metadata each time an LVM command is run), and interfacing with udev to
activate LVM objects as soon as they become available instead of waiting for a
full LVM scan of all block devices to complete during boot before LVM object
activations take place.

However, with lvmetad active, a pvscan of a given device will only wait a few
seconds before the scan attempt times out.  During boot on a system with many
disks present, limited parallel I/O bandwidth, and many pvscan operations
occuring at once, a PV scan of a given device may not finish before it gives
up.  Consequently, LVM objects that depend on the unscanned PV may not activate
automatically during boot, necessitating manual intervention.

A workaround for this problem is to set use_lvmetad=0 in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf,
rebuild the initramfs with dracut, and reboot.  This will prevent the
lvm2-lvmetad.service unit from starting and allow pvscans to complete without
timing out prematurely.
