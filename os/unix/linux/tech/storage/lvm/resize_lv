Add a specified quantity of space to an LV:
# lvresize -L +4GB /dev/myvg/mylvol
# lvresize -l +30 /dev/myvg/mylvol   (adds 30 extents)
# lvresize -l +50%FREE /dev/myvg/mylvol (adds 50% of the free space in the VG)
# lvresize -l -50M /dev/myvg/mylvol   (subtracts 50M from the LV)

# lvresize -r ... : resize filesystem as well as logical volume
   If the filesystem is being shrunk (not possible with XFS), it will be
   unmounted temporarily

lvresize can be used to extend a striped volume to additional storage using a
different number of columns than the original stripe contained, but the
original data remains striped with the original number of columns.  The new
size of the LV should be specified in extents or extents added rather than
-l100%free to ensure that the desired total amount of space is used for the
LV.
