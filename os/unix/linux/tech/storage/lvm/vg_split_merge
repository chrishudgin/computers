Volume groups can be split or merged with vgsplit / vgmerge
All logical volumes in the source VG must be deactivated first, e.g. with
vghange -an vg02

The elements to split off can be specified as logical volumes or physical
volumes, but either way entire physical volumes must be split:

# vgsplit --name lv01 vg01 vg02   # moves all PVs for lv01 from vg01 to vg02

# vgsplit vg01 vg02 /dev/sdaa1 /dev/sdab1
  # moves PVs /dev/sdaa1 and /dev/sdab1 from vg01 to vg02

After the split, the affected LVs in the target VG and all LVs in the source VG
must be reactivated.

To reverse a split, perform the split again but with source and target VGs
exchanged in the vgsplit command.
