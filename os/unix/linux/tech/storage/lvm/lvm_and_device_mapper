LVM is implemented as a layer on top of device mapper, which maps virtual
block devices (volumes, which could be linear, RAID, etc.) to physical devices.

LVM devices like /dev/vg01/lv01 correspond to device mapper devices like
/dev/dm-1.

To convert a device mapper device file to major:minor number:
# dmsetup info /dev/vg01/lv01

To convert a device mapper file's major:minor (e.g. 253:2) number to filename:
# dmsetup info -j 253 -m 2
