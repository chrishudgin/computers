To replace a faulty PV in a non-redundant LV with a PV in a different slot when
the PV to be replaced is still visible but unusable, and data has therefore
been lost:

/dev/sdj at 16:0:6:0 fails, containing PV /dev/sdj1
We will use disk /dev/sdz at 16:0:0:22 containing PV /dev/sdz1
   as its replacement
Check /var/log/messages for H:C:T:L ID (e.g. 16:0:6:0) of failed disk
   and find its device name (e.g. /dev/sdj) from lsscsi
# umount /appl
# lvchange -an /dev/vg02/app_lv
# pvs -o +uuid /dev/sdj1   (the cached UUID should still be shown)
   In this example, the UUID is X3JWIs-IrDn-eda1-i0R5-7r2p-fnrE-Yd8WHJ
# pvscan --cache  (/dev/sdj1 will no longer appear in pvs;
   [unknown] will appear instead)
# echo delete > /sys/block/sdj/device/delete (faulty disk can be replaced later
   with a new disk in the same slot, but we continue with the steps below)
# fdisk /dev/sdz  (create partition table with partition type 8e)
# partprobe /dev/sdz
# pvscan --cache
# pvcreate --restorefile /etc/lvm/backup/vg02 --uuid=X3JWIs-IrDn-eda1-i0R5-7r2p-fnrE-Yd8WHJ /dev/sdz1
# lvchange -ay /dev/vg02/appl_lv
# vgcfgbackup vg02
# mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg02/app_lv
# mount /appl
[Restore data]
To move data to new PV in original slot after the faulty disk is replaced:
# echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host16/scan
# fdisk /dev/sdj (create partition table with partition type 8e)
# partprobe /dev/sdj
# pvcreate /dev/sdj1
# vgextend vg02 /dev/sdj1
# pvmove /dev/sdz1 /dev/sdj1
# vgreduce vg02 /dev/sdz1
# pvremove /dev/sdz1
