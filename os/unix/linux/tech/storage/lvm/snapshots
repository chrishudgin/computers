Create a copy-on-write snapshot of a logical volume:

Note:  It is not necessary to run xfs_freeze before creating an LVM snapshot
of a logical volume with an XFS filesystem on it.  The lvcreate command will
perform the freeze and unfreeze implicitly.

Create the snapshot:

# lvcreate --type snapshot -n applv_snap -L 100m [-p r] /dev/vg02/applv /dev/sdab1
(-p r sets read-only permission instead of the default rw)
(-s can be used instead of --type snapshot)

The lvs command will show the volume type of "s" in LV attributes and will
show the name of the origin LV.

Mount the snapshot (read-write is the default):

# mount -o nouuid[,ro] /dev/vg02/applv_snap /applv_snap

-o nouuid is needed to allow two filesystems (the origin and snapshot LV) with
the same UUID to be mounted at the same time.

Merge the snapshot back into the original, so that the original reverts to
its content when the snapshot was created:

Unmount any filesystems that are mounted on the original and snapshot volume:
# umount /applv_snap
# umount /applv
Merge:
# lvconvert --merge /dev/vg02/applv_snap
When the merge is complete, the snapshot volume is automatically removed.

To remove the snapshot and dispose of its contents instead of merging them:

# umount /applv_snap
# lvremove [-f] /dev/vg02/applv_snap

*****

If a snapshot fills up (when more blocks have been modified on the origin than
exist in the snapshot volume), the state of the snapshot volume will change to
invalid and the snapshot can no longer be used at all.  If a filesystem was
mounted on the snapshot volume, it will be unmounted automatically as soon as
the snapshot volume becomes invalid.

*****

Performing an "lvchange -an" on a snapshot volume will deactivate the origin
volume as well.  If a snapshot is no longer needed, unmount it (if applicable)
and remove it with lvremove.  It does not need to be deactivated with
lvchange -an before removal.
