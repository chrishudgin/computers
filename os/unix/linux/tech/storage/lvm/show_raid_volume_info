To show number of data stripes in a striped volume or the number of mirrored
   copies in a mirrored volume:

# lvs -o name,segtype,data_stripes

To distinguish between number of data stripes and number of mirrors in a
   RAID 10 volume:

# lvs -o name,segtype,data_stripes,stripes
stripes divided by data_stripes is the number of mirrored copies
(RAID 10 in LVM currently supports only two-way mirroring)

To show number of data copies in any volume that uses mirroring:

# lvs -o name,data_copies
(For other types of volumes with redundancy like RAID 5 and RAID 6, data_copies
indicates the number of devices that must be lost before data loss occurs--as
with mirroring)

To show internal sub-volumes of RAID volumes, such as rimage and rmeta
   sub-volumes of mirrors, add the -a option to lvs.

# lvs -a -o vg_name,name,segtype
