SMB automount maps have the following format:

<mountpoint>	-fstype=cifs[,...]	:<UNC_path>

Note the leading colon required before the UNC path for the server and share.

Examples:

A public share (no username or password, all users can read and write
anonymously):

/smb/public -fstype=cifs,password="",noperm ://w10vm1.solarcore.net/Users/Public

A share from a user's home directory, private to their Windows and Linux
accounts:

/smb/chris/mysmb1 -fstype=cifs,credentials=/home/chudgin/smb.cred,uid=chudgin,gid=chudgin ://w10vm1.solarcore.net/Users/chris/mysmb1
