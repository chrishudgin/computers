The list of mount options, if any, following the name of a map or map file (in
auto.master) or mount point directory ("key") in /etc/auto.misc, etc., must be
preceded by a dash.

Customized example from /etc/auto.master (added -suid):
# mount point   map      mount_options
/net            -hosts   -suid

Example from /etc/auto.misc (which automounts /misc/cd):
cd		-fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev	:/dev/cdrom

The mount options field may also be omitted entirely, in which case the default
mount options are used, as in this fictitious example from /etc/auto.misc which
mounts /misc/myzipdrive:

myzipdrive	:/dev/zip

For security reasons, removable drives should always be mounted with (at least)
nosuid.
