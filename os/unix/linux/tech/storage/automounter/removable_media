A removable device (like a CD or USB thumb drive) that is automounted by the
RHEL 7 GNOME desktop will be mounted at /run/media/<username>/<volname>, e.g.:

/run/media/chudgin/RHEL-7.5 Server.x86_64

If a CD at /dev/cdrom (a symlink to /dev/sr0) is not mounted automatically by
the GNOME desktop, it can be automounted by accessing /misc/cd, as configured
in /etc/auto.misc.

USB thumb drives will not automount by default outside of the GNOME desktop
environment.

*****

Eject removable media, e.g. a CD-ROM, automatically unmounting any filesystems
on the device first:

# eject <devname>   (/dev/cdrom by default)

Examples:
# eject /dev/sr0
# eject /dev/sdc (if /dev/sdc is a USB thumb drive, for example)
