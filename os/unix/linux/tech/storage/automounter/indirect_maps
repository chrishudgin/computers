An indirect map allows multiple filesystems to be mounted under (relative to) a
specified directory on the client:

# cat /etc/auto.master.d/export_home.autofs
/export/home	/etc/auto.export_home

# cat /etc/auto.export_home
sherry	server3:/export/home/sherry
layla	server2:/export/home/layla
*	server1:/export/home/&
bonnie	server0:/export/home/bonnie

A wildcard match is attempted last, after all other possible matches have
failed, regardless of where the line with the wildcard key appears in the map
file relative to lines with exact (non-wildcard) keys.

Thus, in the example above, user bonnie would have her home directory mounted
from server0, not server1, because exact matches are attempted before wildcard
matches.
