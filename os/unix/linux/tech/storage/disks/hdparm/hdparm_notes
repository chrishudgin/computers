hdparm can perform throughput testing/measurement (-T and -t) as well as
   get/set many performance tunables for physical hard drives (such as caching
   and read-ahead)
hdparm -g /dev/sda  # show drive geometry
hdparm -I /dev/sda  # display hardware identification details of drive
   (type, model, firmware version, geometry, capabilities, features, physical
    and logical sector sizes)
hdparm --fwdownload /dev/sda  # update drive firmware
hdparm --fibmap /some/file  # show disk extents used by file (fragmentation)
