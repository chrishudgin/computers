Partition limits:

MBR:

Up to 4 primary partitions or up to 3 primary partitions and 1 extended
partition which may have logical drives.  Each logical drive is defined in an
extended boot record (EBR).  The first EBR is located at the beginning of the
extended partition.  Each additional EBR is placed at the beginning of its
respective logical drive.  EBRs form a linked list with no arbitrary length
limit.

BIOS requires the beginning of a partition that is intended to be bootable (and
flagged as such in the MBR) be located within the first 1023 cylinders of a
disk.

GPT:

GPT-partitioned disks can have up to 128 partitions.  They typically have a
fake ("protective") MBR in sector 0 that shows MBR-aware disk utilities the
entire disk used by a single partition.
