fdisk defaults:

Version			DOS compatibility mode	Allocation units
RHEL 6 and earlier	On			Cylinders
RHEL 7			Off			Sectors

On RHEL 6 and earlier, use fdisk -uc to turn off DOS compatibility mode and
use sectors as the allocation unit.  This is not necessary in RHEL 7 and later.

*****

fdisk DOS compatibility mode exists to ensure that newly created partitions on
a previously unpartitioned disk begin and end on cylinder boundaries (a DOS
partitioning requirement).  The first partition created will begin on sector
63, the beginning of the (fudged) second "track" on the disk, which does not
actually correspond to a physical track on modern disks.

Partitioning a disk with a DOS (MBR) partition label does not in itself
guarantee that this DOS partition alignment requirement is met.

For disks that do not have to be accessed by DOS, the DOS cylinder boundary
requirement is not needed and partitions can begin and end on any sector
boundary.  However, some modern disks use 4K physical sector sizes (and thus 4K
I/O sizes) internally instead of traditional 512 byte sectors and I/Os.  On
these disks, partitions should be aligned on 4K (eight 512 byte sector)
boundaries to improve performance.  A manufacturer's use of 4K physical sectors
on a drive reduces space wasted in gaps between sectors and in the number of
error-correcting bytes needed on the disk.

fdisk does not enforce 4K partition boundary alignment, but it does start the
first partition at a 4K boundary, sector 2048 ((2048 * 512 bytes) mod 4096 = 0).
As long as partitions are started at default values and are sized in multiples
of 4 kilobytes, the partitions will be aligned on 4K boundaries.
