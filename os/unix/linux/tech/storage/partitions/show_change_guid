Show the GUID of a disk, as well as other information:
# sgdisk -p /dev/sdb | grep GUID | awk -F: '{print $2}' | tr -d ' '

Note:  If the disk has not actually been formatted as a GPT disk, the displayed
GUID will be a random (garbage) string each time the above command is run.

Show the GUID of a partition (/dev/vdb2 in this example):
# sgdisk -i 2 /dev/vdb | grep "^Partition unique GUID" | awk -F: '{print $2}' | tr -d ' '

Change the GUIDs of a GPT-formatted disk and all of its partitions to a new
random value (e.g. to prepare a clone disk image for independent use):

# sgdisk -G /dev/sdb
