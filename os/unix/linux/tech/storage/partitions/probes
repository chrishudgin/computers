partprobe, partx, and kpartx have different purposes.

After a disk has been partitioned:

The file /proc/partitions contains the kernel's current list of all known
partitions on all disks.  This may not reflect the actual partitioning of the
disks.  partprobe, partx, and kpartx all update the kernel's view of devices
and partitions, as well as creating the necessary device files for them.

partprobe /dev/sda creates partition device files in /dev for "disk" and loop
   devices (e.g. /dev/sda1, /dev/loop0p1).  These are only needed if the "disk"
   partition devices in /dev like /dev/sdb1 will be accessed directly (not
   through parent multipath devices like mpatha1).

   partprobe works in RHEL 5 and 7 but not in RHEL 6 if any partitions on the
   disk are in use.

partx -av /dev/sda informs the kernel of the new partitions so they can be
   used, even if other partitions on the disk are already in use by mounted
   filesystems or active swap.

   partx works in RHEL 6 when partprobe does not.
   partx fails unconditionally in RHEL 7, but partprobe does the jobs of
      partprobe and partx in RHEL 7.

kpartx -av /dev/mapper/mpatha creates device mapper entries in /dev (dm-*) and
   symlinks to them in /dev/mapper (e.g. mpatha1).  These are
   only needed if the partitions on the "disk" devices like sdb will be accessed
   indirectly through device mapper (through multipath devices like mpatha1).

Running partprobe, partx, and kpartx may not flush buffers used to cache
partition layouts on devices (e.g. /dev/sdb and /dev/sdd) that underlie
multipath devices (e.g. /dev/mapper/mpatha).  To flush these buffers so that
fdisk, gdisk, parted, etc. show the partitions on the underlying devices:

# blockdev --flushbufs /dev/sdb /dev/sdd

Detecting and making available partitions contained within a KVM .qcow2 image
requires the use of the guestmount utility rather than partprobe/partx/kpartx.
