I/O schedulers reorder I/O requests to block devices to make the requests more
sequential (less random) for better hard drive performance.

Show I/O elevator (scheduler) currently in use by a device:

# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop [deadline] cfq

Current scheduler in use is enclosed in brackets and may be set automatically
according to storage type.

Temporarily change I/O elevator (scheduler) in use by a device:

# echo cfq > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
noop deadline [cfq]

To change the system-wide I/O scheduler, add the following line to the kernel
line in the GRUB configuration:

elevator=deadline  (or eleavator=cfq or elevator=noop)

On RHEL 7, this would be done by adding it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in
/etc/default/grub and running grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

"Deadline" favors throughput but potentially higher latency for
   interactive processes since processes using heavy I/O will get more frequent
   service.  Good policy for database disks.
"Completely Fair Queueing" (cfq) provides low latency but gives each process
   an equal I/O share via round-robin, regardless of how much I/O a process
   needs to perform.  Good policy for a root disk.
"NOOP" does no reordering of I/O requests and is good for devices
   with no rotational latency (or rotational latency masked by caching) like
   flash storage, some SAN LUNs, or RAM disks.
