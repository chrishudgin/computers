To show the serial port hardware physically present in a server:

# setserial -g /dev/ttyS*
(UART "unknown" is shown if port is not physically present or UART is not
 recognized)
# dmesg | grep tty

*****

To change the serial port speed that the kernel uses for a given port, add
the speed in bps to the console= argument on the kernel command line.

Example in /etc/default/grub on RHEL 7:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto rd.lvm.lv=rhel_server1/root console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200"

In KVM guest machines, the virtual serial port is set to 9600 bps by default
but can be configured to a different speed as shown above.

Also update the parameter GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND in /etc/default/grub to set
the desired serial port speed.

Example in /etc/default/grub on RHEL 7:

GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
