logrotate configuration is read from:
/etc/logrotate.conf  (general and default options)
/etc/logrotate.d/*   (package-specific configuration files)

All directives for logrotate configuration files are described in logrotate(8).

*****

/var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status contains the time and date of the last
rotation for each rotated log file.  Each such record is initialized with the
first run of logrotate on the server.

*****

/var/log/audit/audit.log is not rotated by logrotate.  auditd rotates its own
log files automatically when they reach a certain size, as determined by the
max_log_file setting (which defaults to 8 MB) in /etc/audit/auditd.conf.
