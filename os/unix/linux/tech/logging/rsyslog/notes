rsyslog configuration is contained in:
/etc/rsyslog.conf
/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

The available facilities and priorities are described in syslog(3).

*****

rsyslogd performs asynchronous writes by default.  The default can be changed
   in /etc/rsyslog.conf, with asynchronous writes selectively enabled for a
   given log file by prepending it with a "-", as in -/var/log/maillog

*****

In addition to sending log output to files, rsyslog can also send log output
to a module, as in:
*.emerg							:omusrmsg:*
which sends messages at the emergency priority through the omusrmsg (output
module user message) module to all logged in users (*).

*****

rsyslog can use files as an input source with the imfile module in
/etc/rsyslog.conf :

$ModLoad imfile

followed by directives that indicate the filename to monitor, monitoring
interval, log facility and level, etc.

This feature is useful for logging events through the syslog facility from
software that cannot be configured to use syslog but does create its own log
file.

*****

To log only messages of a specified priority rather than messages of that
priority and higher, prepend = to the priority in /etc/rsyslog.conf, as in:
cron.=debug						-/var/log/cron.debug

Priorities can also be negated by prepending them with !

*****

For remote logging destinations in /etc/rsyslog.conf, @remote-host sends syslog
messages via UDP and @@remote-host sends them via TCP.

*****

Local logging facilites are local0 through local7.  In RHEL 7, local7 is used
for /var/log/boot.log.
