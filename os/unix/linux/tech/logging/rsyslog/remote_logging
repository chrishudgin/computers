On the server:

Uncomment lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf to allow UDP or TCP connections.

For UDP connections:
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514

For TCP connections:
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514

Optionally, create a template for a syslog file path that includes the hostname
of the logging client so that each client's logs (including those of the
central logging host) will be directed (but not exclusively) to its own file
on the central logging host.  Without redirection to a template filename,
all client log messages will be written to the same set of log files used by
the central logging host for its own local messages.

Create a template file path and a rule that uses it by appending the following
lines to /etc/rsyslog.conf:

$template DynamicFile, "/var/log/loghost/%HOSTNAME%/%syslogfacility-text%.log"
*.* -?DynamicFile

(The - character means asynchronous writes)

All variables available for use in dynamic filenames are documented in the
"Available Properites" section of rsyslog.conf(5).

Comment out or modify other entries in /etc/rsyslog.conf on the central loghost
so that messages from clients are not logged to the loghost's standard syslog
files anymore, only to the new dynamic files.

Configure logrotate to rotate any new dynamic log file names.  In this example,
add the following line to the list of files managed in /etc/logrotate.d/syslog:
/var/log/loghost/*/*.log

Open the firewall to allow remote connections.

For UDP connections:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=syslog
# firewall-cmd --reload

For TCP connections:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload

Restart the rsyslog service:
# systemctl restart rsyslog

rsyslogd will now listen for connections on port 514/udp or port 514/tcp:
# lsof -i :514
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
rsyslogd 21579 root    3u  IPv4 340443      0t0  TCP *:shell (LISTEN)
rsyslogd 21579 root    4u  IPv6 340444      0t0  TCP *:shell (LISTEN)

*****

On the clients:

Add a line like the following to /etc/rsyslog.conf, using the actual FQDN of
the central loghost:
*.* @@server1.example.com:514

Restart the rsyslog service on the clients:
# systemctl restart rsyslog
