On systems like RHEL 7 with both systemd and rsyslog:

syslog(3) writes to the socket /dev/log
systemd-journald reads from /dev/log
rsyslogd reads from /run/log/journal/*/system.journal
   and /run/systemd/journal/socket

Kernel messages are captured by systemd-journald as it reads /dev/kmsg.  The
kernel logs its messages to /dev/console even if systemd-journald and rsyslog
do not (unless the kernel option "quiet" was set at boot).  Therefore, the
following line in /etc/rsyslog.conf is not necessary and is commented out by
default:

#kern.*                                                 /dev/console
