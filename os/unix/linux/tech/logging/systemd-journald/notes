systemd-journald collects data from a variety of sources and logs to a circular
buffer in binary file /run/log/journal/.../system.journal

*****

From systemd-journald.service(8) :

"The systemd service manager invokes all service processes with standard output
and standard error connected to the journal [the socket
/run/systemd/journal/stdout] by default."

This can be seen in lsof output for daemon processes, e.g.:

# lsof -p $(systemctl show -p MainPID sshd | cut -d= -f2) -a -d 1,2
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME
sshd    1131 root    1u  unix 0xffff90a2b8219c00      0t0 22537 socket
sshd    1131 root    2u  unix 0xffff90a2b8219c00      0t0 22537 socket

A persistent (disk-based) systemd-journald log is made only if in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf, either Storage=persistent, or Storage=auto and
the directory /var/log/journal exists.

To activate /var/log/journal:
# mkdir /var/log/journal
# systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
   (This ensures the correct mode, owners, and ACLs are set for the directory)
# killall -USR1 systemd-journald
The following command should not be necessary but is precautionary:
# systemctl restart rsyslog.service

To deactivate /var/log/journal:
# rm -rf /var/log/journal
   (This will destroy the contents of the journal)
systemd-journald should now create /run/log/journal automatically.
Set permissions and ACLs:
# systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /run/log/journal
The following two commands should not be necessary but are precautionary:
# systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
# systemctl restart rsyslog.service

*****

Sizing constraints for the journal can be configured in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf.  If the journal size exceeds these constraints,
the beginning of the journal will be overwritten as new events are logged.
