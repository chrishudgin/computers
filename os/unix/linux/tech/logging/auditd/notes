systemd service and daemon are both called auditd.

Configuration file is /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Log file is /var/log/audit/audit.log

"Watch rules" are created using auditctl.
Rule parameters are documented in audit.rules(7).

Set a non-persistent watch rule (change does not survive reboot):
# auditctl -w <watched_path> -p r|w|x|a -k <name_for_key>
   If watched_path is a directory, the watch is recursive
   -p r, w, x : log syscalls that open a file for reading, writing, execution
   -p a : log syscalls that change the attributes of a watched file
      -p options can be combined as, for example, rwa
   -k <name_for_key> : assign an arbitrary key name to this watch rule
Example:
   # auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p a -k shadow_watch
   # auditctl -w /etc/sysconfig/ -p rwa -k sysconfig_watch

Delete a non-persistent watch rule (change does not survive reboot):
# auditctl -W <watched_path> ... (remainder of rule)

Delete all non-persistent watch rules:
# auditctl -D

Add a persistent rule:
Append all auditctl arguments and options for each desired watch rule (but not
   the auditctl command name itself), one rule per line, to
   /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
Restart auditd using service command (not systemctl):
# service auditd restart

The first rule in audit.rules that matches an event is used to log that event.

List active custom watch rules:
# auditctl -l

Search by key name for events matching an audited watch rule:
# ausearch [-i] -k <name_for_key>
   -i : interpret system call numbers and numeric UIDs/GIDs (translate to names)

Search for all events pertaining to a filename:
# ausearch [-i] -f <filename>
   -i : interpret system call numbers and numeric UIDs/GIDs (translate to names)

Many other search options are available.

Log entries include the timestamp in seconds since the epoch, audit event ID,
filesystem object name, ownership, and SELinux context, as well as the command
name, its PID, process UID/GID, and its SELinux context.

A single event can generate multiple log entries, each with the same audit
event ID after the timestamp.
