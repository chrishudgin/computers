Red Hat recommends:

RAM		Swap
------------	-------
< 2 GB		2 x RAM
2 GB to 8 GB	1 x RAM
> 8 GB		1/2 x RAM

The "Inactive(anon)" field in /proc/meminfo indicates how much memory can
safely be paged out to the swap device(s) (and potentially replaced by pages
that are already swapped out) without the likelihood of affecting the
performance of currently running processes.

If swap used is greater than the value of inactive anonymous memory, then
performance problems may result if all the swapped pages are needed.  This is
because cached pages would then need to be reclaimed or active pages would need
to be stolen (and swapped) in order to make room for the previously swapped
pages beyond what was available from reclaiming inactive anonymous memory.
