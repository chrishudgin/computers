The priority of a swap device can be set using the "pri=" mount option, as in
these sample entries from /etc/fstab:

UUID=476d0158-3717-40fe-892f-0980e9c4e589 swap swap pri=2 0 0
UUID=cea5610b-a590-4f87-8dfb-cbd4364880fa swap swap pri=1 0 0
UUID=b66ed4a3-44c0-4f5d-ae91-622f6f87b8fc swap swap defaults 0 0

Priorities can range from -1 (the default) to 32767, with higher numbers
meaning higher priority.  Lower priority swap devices do not start to be used
until all space in higher priority swap spaces is in use.  Multiple swap
devices with the same priority are used round-robin.
