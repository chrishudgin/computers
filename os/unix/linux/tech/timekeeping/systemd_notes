systemd includes its own NTP time synchronization daemon, systemd-timesyncd.
The systemd-timesyncd service will not run if it detects that any other time
synchronization software is installed:

# cat /lib/systemd/system/systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf
[Unit]
# don't run timesyncd if we have another NTP daemon installed
ConditionFileIsExecutable=!/usr/sbin/ntpd
ConditionFileIsExecutable=!/usr/sbin/openntpd
ConditionFileIsExecutable=!/usr/sbin/chronyd
ConditionFileIsExecutable=!/usr/sbin/VBoxService

*****

systemd-timesyncd synchronizes the system clock to a single time source using
the SNTP protocol.  The list of time servers from which systemd-timesyncd
chooses can be overridden from the default values by setting the variables NTP
and (optionally) FallbackNTP in /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf, each as a
space-separated argument list.
