Processes inherit their nice level from their parent process.
Default nice value for any process in SCHED_OTHER (the default scheduling
   class) is 0.
Default nice value for a command run as "nice /some/command" is 10.

nice -n <nice#> <command>
renice -n <nice#> <PID>
   nice# ranges from -20 (least nice) to 19 (nicest)
   When run as a non-privileged user, renice can only increase a process's
     niceness or leave it unchanged.

ps -o pri shows process priorities ranging from 0 (lowest) to 39 (highest)
   with a default priority of 19
   and real time processes are shown with a priority of 139
pri = -(nice) + 19

ps -o ni shows nice level ranging from -20 (least nice) to 19 (nicest).

top shows process priorities ranging from 0 (highest) to 39 (lowest)
   with a default priority of 0
   and real time processes are shown with a priority of "rt"
PRI = NICE + 20
