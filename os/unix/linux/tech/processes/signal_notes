SIGKILL will immediately terminate even a stopped process, unless it is in
uninterruptible sleep.

Other signals may not be delivered to a process that is stopped until the
process wakes up.  In bash, a signal sent by jobspec (but not by PID) to a
stopped background job will cause the job's processes to wake up so that they
can process the signal immediately.
