Processes are not sorted by ps by default.  To guarantee sorting by start time
or some other field, use the "k" option or --sort= followed by one or more
comma-separated field names, as in: ps k [+|-]<field1>[,[+|-]<field2>,...]
Optional + and - preceding each field name select sort in ascending order
(default) or descending order.

*****

ps can accept one or more space-separated PIDs as arguments.

Example:
$ ps 547 12900 4682

*****

Filter by exact command name (not regex) without using grep:
# ps -C <cmdname>

*****

Unlimited line width (i.e. don't truncate output of each process to a single
line):

$ ps ww
or
$ ps -ww

Two w options result in unlimited output width per process

*****

Custom column width (useful to avoid truncation of printed value when a field
value length exceeds the standard width of a specified column):

$ ps -o <field name>:<length in characters>

Example:
$ ps -o user:20,group:20,pid

*****

Show process hierarchy with ASCII art:

$ ps f ...


Alternatively, use pstree

$ pstree [PID|username]

$ pstree -p : include PIDs
         -a : include process args and show each process on a separate line
         -l : long (don't truncate process args)
         -s : include parent processes (default is to show only children)

*****

Sort by process start time:

$ ps k start_time [-ef ...]

*****

Show job info (PID, PPID, PGID, SID, TTY, TPGID, STAT, COMMAND) for all
processes associated with a terminal:

$ ps j

*****

There is an "lwp" field available in ps, but in order to see each LWP in the
output, it is necessary to add the -L flag.

Example:

$ ps -L -eo lwp,pid,args

*****

Show login UID (new in RHEL 7.6):

$ ps -o luid [...]

*****

Prevent display of headers:

$ ps --no-headers
