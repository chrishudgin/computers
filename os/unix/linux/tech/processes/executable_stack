To determine whether a running process has an executable stack, use
   pmap $PID | grep stack

Query executable stack flag for a binary executable or library:

$ execstack -q jts
X jts

X indicates that the binary is marked with the "executable stack required" flag.
- would indicate that it is not.
? would indicate "unknown" (the header does not include the flag).

Clearing the executable stack flag on a binary that has it set and that
requires an executable stack will result in a segmentation fault when the
binary is executed, as soon as an attempt is made to execute code on the stack.
