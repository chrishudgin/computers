To determine the type of event for which a sleeping process is waiting,
check the "wchan" field in the "ps" command.

Example for a process that is running on a terminal with Ctrl-S set (
suspend terminal output):

$ ps -o wchan 3877
WCHAN
n_tty_write

Example for a process that has explicitly called sleep():
$ ps -o wchan 3899
WCHAN
hrtimer_nanosleep

Example for a process that has called wait() to wait for a child process:
$ ps -o wchan 3866
WCHAN
wait
