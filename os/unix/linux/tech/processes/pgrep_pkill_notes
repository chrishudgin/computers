pgrep and pkill support extended regular expressions as patterns to match

pgrep -a <string>  : show full command line of process whose command name
   matches string
   (pgrep -l shows command name of matched process but not its arguments)
   -f : match string against full process command lines, not just command names
        (e.g. match "libexec" in a process running /usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_be)

pgrep and pkill have many other options to match against other selection
criteria like parent process PID, newest process matched, processes in a given
process group or associated with a given terminal or user, etc.

*****

pkill sends a SIGTERM by default.  However, when used with -u username, pkill
first sends a SIGTERM and then SIGHUP and SIGCONT to all processes owned by the
specified user.  Login shells ignore SIGTERM, but they terminate when sent
SIGHUP.  Thus, for example, the following commands will have different effects
even when the same processes are involved:

$ pkill -t pts/1  (sends SIGTERM; login shell ignores, but children are terminated)
$ pkill -u testuser (sends SIGTERM, terminating children, then SIGHUP which
terminates login shell as well)
