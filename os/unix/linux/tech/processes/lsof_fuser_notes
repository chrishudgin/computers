lsof /somefile   # show processes that have /somefile open

lsof /mntpt   # show all open files in a filesystem
lsof +L1 -a /mntpt   # show only open deleted files in a filesystem
   (+L1 means limit to files with a link count less than 1)

lsof -p PID   # limit to a given process
lsof -p PID -a -d 0-2  # limit to a given process and given file descriptors

lsof -c string   # limit to processes starting with string
lsof -c /regex/  # limit to processes matching regex

lsof /dir   # show open files in /dir but not its subdirectories
lsof +d /dir  # show open files in /dir and its immediate subdirectories
lsof +D /dir   # same as +d but recurse subdirectories
   Unless /dir is a mount point, these three commands will not show files that
   are open but deleted, because searching a directory tree will find only
   files that still appear within it--i.e. files that still have directory
   entries (names), which deleted files do not.

   To find open, deleted files within a filesystem, use "lsof +L1 -a /mntpt"

lsof -i [TCP|UDP]@[hostname|ipaddr][:port]  # show connections to hostname or
   ipaddr and/or port number

lsof -a  # applies logical AND to all conditions given on command line,
   regardless of where the "-a" appears on the command line
   (default behavior is to apply logical OR to all conditions
    except negations denoted by ^ before a specifier string like a username)

*****

fuser /somefile   # show processes that have /somefile open
fuser ssh/tcp  # show processes that have TCP port 22 open
fuser -m   # same as fuser -c
fuser -k -SIGNAL /dir  # send SIGNAL instead of default SIGKILL to processes
   with open files in /dir
fuser -v   # verbose (includes command name)
   and list each PID on a separate line
