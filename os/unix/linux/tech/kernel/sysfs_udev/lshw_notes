For reporting information on specific types of hardware (like disks or RAID
controllers), dedicated tools like hdparm, ethtool, and vendor tools will
often provide the most complete and accurate information.

lshw, when run as superuser, provides an overview of all installed hardware
with some ability to drill down to obtain more detail (see the -class option
below).

lshw also lists the driver used for each detected peripheral device.

Useful examples:

Summary mode:
# lshw -short

Show firmware specifications, cache levels and sizes, and physical DIMM layout
(slots, installed capacity in each slot, DIMM serial numbers, vendors, model
numbers):
# lshw -class memory

Show summary data for each device by its bus address:
# lshw -businfo

Show details for all detected devices in a specified hardware class:
# lshw -class <class_type>

where <class_type> is one of the following or possibly some other category
found in the "Class" columnn of the output of "lshw -short":

system (including system serial number)
memory (see example above)
disk (including disk firmware and disk serial numbers)
storage (controllers)
network
bus (including motherboard)
processor
generic
communication
volume (including partitions and filesystems)
bridge
input
multimedia
display (video card)
