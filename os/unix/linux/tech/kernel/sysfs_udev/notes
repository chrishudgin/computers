/sys/bus/*/drivers contains a list of drivers required for devices on the
various buses.

udev uses /sys entries and udev rules in /{lib,etc}/udev/rules.d to create
entries dynamically in /dev.

# udevadm control --reload : reload udev rule files after making changes
   to them.  This does not perform any triggers.

# udevadm trigger [path] : send "change" event to all subsystems, causing
   /dev files to be rebuilt.  Device scope can be narrowed with options to
   select certain device names, properties, and attributes; details in
   udevadm(8).  [path] should begin with /dev.

# udevadm [-a] -p /sys/block/sda : show device properties or attributes
   for /dev/sda

# udevadm info -q path /dev/sda : show the path in /sys for /dev/sda

# udevadm info --export-db : dump info for all devices, including names, paths,
   and udev environment variables for each device that can be used to create
   and modify rules.

# udevadm monitor : show udev events in real time

Values in udev rules files are specified as:
KEY==value_to_compare, KEY=value_to_assign
   (note == vs. =)

In addition to matching against the static attributes of a device, udev can
also check the result (output) of a user-specified command (such as
/usr/lib/udev/scsi_id) in a rule description to match a particular device.
