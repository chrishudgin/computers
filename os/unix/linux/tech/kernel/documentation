Documentation for the kernel is available at:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation

and for any specific kernel version in the Documentation directory of the
source tarball.

The documentation is not comprehensive; rather, the aim is to document features
of note to developers and end users, including tunable parameters.
