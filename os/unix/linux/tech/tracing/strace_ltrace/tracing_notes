ltrace     # trace library calls
ltrace -l libfoo.so.1  # limit output to calls to specified library file
   (don't include the path to the library file, only the filename)
ltrace -S  # trace library calls as well as system calls ("syscallname@SYS")
ltrace -e somefunc@libfoo   # limit tracing to calls to somefunc in libfoo.*
ltrace -x somefunc  # trace entry to somefunc in the executable itself
ltrace -L   # omit tracing of library calls  (useful with -S or -x)

Wildcards (e.g. '*') are supported for arguments to the -e and -x options
