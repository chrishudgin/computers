An "at" job is stored as an executable shell script.  The user's environment
variables (except for a few like linker preload paths) and their current values
are copied into the script as they were at the time the "at" command was run.
The commands to run are stored at the bottom of the script in a here document.

"at" runs jobs from the directory from which the "at" command was run (it
changes into that directory before running the commands listed in the job).

When an "at" job runs, it is not associated with a terminal and is therefore
not liable to be terminated at user logout as a job in an interactive login
session might be.

General syntax:
# at [options] <timespec> [<datespec>]
where a fully specified timespec is of the form HH:MM
and a fully specified datespec is of the form YYYY-MM-DD

Start time can also be specified as a base plus additive, e.g.,
# at now + 4 hours
The additive can be expressed in minutes, hours, days, or weeks.
"at 3 pm + 3 days" means 3 PM three days from today, regardless of the current
time (i.e. regardless of whether it is currently before or after 3 PM).

Submit script to run through at:
# at -f /some/script ...
The entire script is copied into the 

Show "at" job content for a given job number:
# at -c

List all pending jobs for user (or all users if run as root):
# atq

Query or submit job to designated queue:
# at -q [a-zA-Z]
"at" supports optional job queues denoted by a single letter, a through z
   or A through Z (capital letters trigger batch-style processing), in
   descending order of priority (higher nice numbers).
   The default queue for an "at" job is queue a.
   The default queue for a "batch" job is queue b.

*****

Best practice is to set the PATH explicitly or specify full paths to commands
in "at" jobs.

*****

One useful role for "at" is to set up a job to reset some part of the system
configuration to a known, safe value after a few minutes when a potentially
risky command is about to be run (such as a command that might disable network
access if it fails to work properly).  If the potentially risky command does
work as intended, the administrator can then remove the pending "at" job before
it resets the configuration.
