Contrary to what is documented in crontab(5), for cron jobs that run hourly or
   less frequently:
crond runs jobs that were scheduled in the "missing" hours of a DST forward
   time adjustment run immediately after the time adjustment occurs.
During a backward DST time jump (to standard time), jobs scheduled during the
   clock hours that occur twice are run only once.

The documentation in crond(8) regarding Daylight Saving Time is correct.
