If both the day-of-month and day-of-week field (third and fifth fields in
crontab) are not *, they are logically OR'd with the each other, so that the
following cron job will run at 5:01 on April 3rd as well as on every Wednesday
in April:
1 5 3 4 3 /bin/ls

However, the following cron job will run only on April 3rd:
1 5 3 4 * /bin/ls

and the following cron job will run only on Wednesdays in April:
1 5 * 4 3 /bin/ls

*****

crontab entry fields can also use lists (e.g. 1,2,7), ranges (e.g. 1-5) and
divisors representing intervals (e.g. */10 meaning once every ten time units).
Strings like "@yearly" or "@hourly" can be used as the entire time
specification (jobs will be run at the beginning of the specified interval), as
well as the string "@reboot" to run a job once after reboot.
