One way to run a script once every two weeks through cron:

0 6 * * 2 expr `date +\%s` / 604800 \% 2 >/dev/null || /scripts/fortnightly.sh

This checks whether the number of times that a week's worth of seconds has
elapsed since the epoch is divisible by 2.

This can still potentially fail during DST changes and leap seconds.

Alternatively, keep a persistent marker and toggle it each time the weekly
cron job runs.
