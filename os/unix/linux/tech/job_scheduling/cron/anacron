The purpose of anacron is to ensure that certain jobs run periodically on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis even if the system is not up continuously, and
when the exact time of day that a job runs is not important.

anacron is not separate daemon or service but rather a utility run periodically
as a cron job.

Linkage between cron and anacron:
cron runs all jobs contained in files in /etc/cron.d, including
/etc/cron.d/0hourly, which contains the following job:
   01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
run-parts runs all scripts in a directory.
/etc/cron.hourly/0anacron runs anacron.

Thus, in order for anacon to run, the system need only be online at one minute
past the hour, and running cron, at least once per day.  However, the setting
START_HOURS_RANGE=3-22 in /etc/anacrontab limits which hours of the day anacron
will run the daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.  During this hour range, an
anacron job that is eligible to run (because it has not run in at least one
day, week, or month) will run at:

Time that 0hourly runs /etc/cron.hourly/0anacron (1 minute past the hour) +
base delay in minutes from /etc/anacrontab + RANDOM_DELAY in minutes from
/etc/anacrontab

The schedule for running jobs in /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly}
   is maintained in /etc/anacrontab.
   The last run date for each is stored in
      /var/spool/anacron/cron.{daily, weekly, monthly}
