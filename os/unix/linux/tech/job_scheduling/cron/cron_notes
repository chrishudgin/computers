Running the crontab without any options or arguments overwrites the user's
existing crontab.

*****

To specify another user's crontab, use:
   crontab -u username ...

*****

Environment variables can be set in crontab files, on their own lines.  The
default PATH within a cron job is /usr/bin:/bin.  As with any other environment
variable, PATH can be set to a different value in the crontab file itself or in
whatever script or program is run by the cron job.  The scope of a PATH setting
is limited to the particular crontab file in which it is set.

Best practice is to set the PATH explicitly or specify full paths to commands
in cron jobs.

*****

The intent behind the /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} directories is to
allow packages and administrators to drop in scripts to run at the specified
intervals without having to specify particular times.

*****

cron mails the combined standard output and standard error from a job to the
   user unless stdout and stderr are redirected in the crontab entry

*****

Text occurring after an unescaped % sign in a crontab entry is sent as standard
input to the command; subsequent unescaped % signs in the entry are interpreted
as newlines.
