By default (with no options), and in the first output report when given a
repeat interval, iostat shows cumulative CPU and storage device usage
statistics since the last boot.

iostat [device1] [device2] [...]  # show disk device I/O statistics
   device can be a partition or a whole disk
iostat -d [device1] [device2] [...] # omit CPU statistics
iostat -x [device1] [device2] [...] # add extended statistics to report,
   including wait time, service time, and % utilization
   (svctm field is deprecated; use await)
iostat -y  # omit cumulative statistics since last boot
iostat -m  # report in megabytes instead of kilobytes
iostat -h  # add a blank line between each device's statistics for readability
iostat -N  # show LVM VG/LV names rather than device mapper (dm-*) names
iostat -p  # include partitions in output
