CPU power/frequency tuning parameters are in:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/*

Show available CPU governor policies:
# cpupower frequency-info --governors

Get the speed governor setting for all CPUs:
# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance

Get all current CPU power/frequency settings:
# cpupower frequency-info
See cpupower-frequency-info(1) for details.

If this command reports "no or unknown cpufreq driver is active on this CPU",
a system BIOS setting may need to be changed from system power management to
OS power management (OS DBPM on Dell PowerEdge servers).

Set CPU power/frequency settings non-persistently:
# cpupower frequency-set <options>

Example:
# cpupower frequency-set -g performance

On RHEL 7, these and other hardware and kernel performance settings are managed
collectively as persistent but customizable tuned(8) profiles.
