To install ABRT:

# yum install abrt-cli

Then reboot to ensure all ABRT services are started, such as abrtd, abrt-oops,
and abrt-ccpp ("ccpp" means C/C++ and handles crashes created by binary
executables).

By default, the kernel dumps core files into the crashed program's current
directory according to the filename pattern specified in
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern (default pattern is simply "core", to which is
appended a dot and the crashed process's PID).  When ABRT starts, it
overwrites the contents of this file with a pipe to /usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp
followed by filename pattern specifiers (%s %c etc.)  Restarting abrtd does not
reinstall the core_pattern hook; to do that, restart abrt-ccpp.service.

ABRT is configured in /etc/abrt and /etc/libreport

ABRT will not necessarily generate a full ccpp report for every core dump.  For
example, by default, programs that are not part of a GPG-signed RPM package
will not have a report generated for them.  Neither will processes that die
from a SIGQUIT, for example.  Processes that die from a SIGSEGV will, though.

To generate an ABRT report even for programs that were not installed as part
of a package, set the following variable in abrt-action-save-package-data.conf:
ProcessUnpackaged = yes

ABRT will not only capture information about the terminated process in
   /var/spool/abrt/ccpp-*, it will also generate an sosreport in that
   directory to capture system configuration information.

ABRT will also generate reports for kernel oopses, system crash dumps, and
   python crashes.
