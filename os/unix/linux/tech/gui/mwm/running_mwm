Install motif and xterm packages

Create ~/.xinitrc:
xterm bash

Set the default systemd target to multi-user:
# systemctl set-default multi-user.target
# systemctl isolate multi-user.target

Log into console as a non-root user and run:
xinit

In the xterm window that appears, enter
mwm &

To revert to standard GNOME desktop:

Exit from all running xterms.  This will cause mwm and X to stop as well.
rm ~/.xinitrc

# systemctl set-default graphical.target
# systemctl isolate graphical.target
