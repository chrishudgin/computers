Upstart does not have "goal jobs" (like systemd targets) for which it must
resolve dependencies in order to reach a goal or target.  Instead, it starts
and stops jobs in response to events, which can include other jobs starting and
stopping.

Upstart monitors the following events:

startup (generated at system startup)

and for individual jobs:

starting
started
stopping
stopped

Upstart also triggers runlevel events which set the runlevel and run the
appropriate jobs for that runlevel.
