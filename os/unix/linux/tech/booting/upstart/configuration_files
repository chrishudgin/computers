The configuration files for Upstart are:

/etc/init.conf

and for individual jobs (services or tasks):
/etc/init/[*/]*.[conf!override]

where a .override file must be accompanied by a corresponding .conf file and
contains stanzas that override identically named stanzas in the .conf file
with the same base filename.

Some jobs configured by the configuration files also source the file
/etc/sysconfig/init which contains variables affecting the behavior of init and
some of its jobs.

Upstart monitors its configuration files and directories continuously and
processes changes to them as soon as they occur.
