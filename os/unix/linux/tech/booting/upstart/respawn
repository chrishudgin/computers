If a service exits unexpectedly (without a "stop" command or the occurrence of
an event that is configured to stop it) and is configured with a respawn
stanza, Upstart will respawn it.  A task will not be respawned automatically
after it exits unless it it has a respawn stanza AND exits with a nonzero exit
status.

If a service or task is configured to respawn, respawn limits may be set.  The
default limits are 10 respawns within 5 seconds, after which the job is
considered failed and unrecoverable.

With a "normal exit" stanza, a custom list of allowable exit statuses and
terminating signals for a job may be configured to prevent the job respawning
when they occur.
