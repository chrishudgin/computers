Multiple instances of a job are supported through the "instance" stanza in job
configuration files.  Instance stanzas expand variable names.  Thus, the name
of an instance can be set on the command line when starting a job and will be
passed to the instance stanza during job startup.

Example:

# grep TTYNAME /etc/init/myttys.conf
instance $TTYNAME
exec /bring/up/some/tty $TTYNAME
# initctl start myttys TTYNAME=ttyS0  # starts the mytty job with instance ttyS0
# initctl status myttys TTYNAME=ttyS0
myttys (ttyS0) start/running, process 1367
