Dependencies that govern job start/stop order may be created as in these
examples:

For a service job that depends on foo running:

start on started foo (this job will start only after foo is completely started)
stop on stopping foo (this job will stop completely before foo begins to stop)

For a service job on which foo depends:

start on starting foo (this job will start completely before foo starts)
stop on stopped foo (this job will begin stopping only after foo is stopped)
