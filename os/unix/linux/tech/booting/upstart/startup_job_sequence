To start legacy System V init scripts and single-user or emergency boot modes,
Upstart runs the following jobs using the job configuration files
/etc/init/<jobname>.conf :

rcS :
   If the argument "emergency" was passed to the kernel command line,
      run the rcS-emergency job
   Run /etc/rc.d/sysinit, which sets hostname, configures devices,
      checks and mounts filesystems, and sets SELinux contexts
   Set the runlevel to the default value in /etc/inittab
   Run the "rc" job

rc :
   Run the shell script /etc/rc.d/rc with the target runlevel as a parameter.
      The "rc" script then runs the System V init scripts in
         /etc/rc.d/rc<runlevel>.d

rcS-emergency :
   Source /etc/sysconfig/init, which contains variables affecting the behavior
      of Upstart itself, then run the emergency shell sulogin or sushell.
  
rcS-sulogin :
   Source /etc/sysconfig/init, which contains variables affecting the behavior
      of Upstart itself, then run the emergency shell sulogin or sushell.
   Run sushell upon entering single-user mode
