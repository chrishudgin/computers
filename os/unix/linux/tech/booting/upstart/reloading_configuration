Upstart uses inotify to monitor the files in /etc/init, so manual requests to
init to reload its configuration are not normally necessary.  Even so, such a
request can be sent with any of the following commands:

# initctl reload-configuration (note that this does not start jobs)
# [tel]init u (causes init to re-execute, useful when system libs are updated)
# [tel]init q (for backward compatibility with System V init)
