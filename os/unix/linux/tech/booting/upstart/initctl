The symlinks to initctl in /sbin called start, stop, restart, reload, and
status cause initctl to run in the corresponding command mode.

The restart command argument to initctl will stop and start a named job, but
only if the job is already running.  If the named job is not running, restart
has no effect.

The reload command argument to initctl sends the SIGHUP signal to the main
process of the named job.

The emit command argument to initctl can be used to emit an arbitrary event to
Upstart, triggering all configured responses for that event to run.
