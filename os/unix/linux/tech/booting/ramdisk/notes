Dracut configuration variables are set in:
/usr/lib/dracut/dracut.conf.d/*.conf
/etc/dracut.conf.d/*.conf
/etc/dracut.conf

Dracut modules (actually shell scripts) reside in:
/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/*/*

*****

If systemd on the initial ramdisk is unable to mount the specified root
filesystem, it will, after a default timeout of 1 minute 30 seconds, drop
to an emergency shell.

*****

All commands understood by the dracut interpreter on the initial ramdisk (like
rd.break, ro, root=..., etc.) are documented in dracut.cmdline(7).

*****

On a KVM console, the default pager (less) may be unable to display ASCII
graphics characters seen in the output of commands such as "systemctl
list-dependencies".  To prevent systemctl sending its output to a pager:
# systemctl ... --no-pager
or
# SYSTEMD_PAGER=""

Alternatively, pass the option --plain to "systemctl list-dependencies" to omit
ASCII graphics characters in the output.

*****

In the dracut shell (the interactive bash shell that runs when the rd.break
directive is passed on the kernel command line), individual LVM commands are
available only as arguments to the lvm command, e.g.:

# lvm lvs

instead of

# lvs
