Rebuild a missing or corrupted initramfs for a specific kernel while booted to residerescue disk:

# chroot /mnt/sysimage
# dracut -f --kver 3.10.0-862.3.3.el7.x86_64
# exit
# exit

The system will reboot automatically.  A second boot to the desired kernel /
ramdisk menu entry may be necessary in order for the normal boot process to
complete.
