If the normal root filesystem is mounted on /mnt/sysimage:

If necessary, make /dev, /sys, and /proc available under /mnt/sysimage:
(These steps are done automatically in the RHEL 7.5 DVD rescue mode when
 the "Continue" option is selected to mount the root fs on /mnt/sysimage)
# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/sysimage/dev
# mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sysimage/sys
# mount -o bind /proc /mnt/sysimage/proc

Then:
# chroot /mnt/sysimage
# grub2-install /dev/sda  (or other boot disk on which /mnt/sysimage is located)
# exit
# exit

The system will then reboot automatically, relabel files with SELinux contexts,
and automatically reboot again.
