Q.  How do kernel command line arguments that were added manually to the
GRUB configuration file get copied to the new kernel entry when a new kernel
package is installed?

A.  The kernel RPM includes a postinstall scriptlet (as shown by
rpm -q --scripts kernel-X.XX.XX) that runs the script /usr/sbin/new-kernel-pkg,
which calls grubby with the --copy-default option.

Q.  How to find out which disks are seen by GRUB, and which ones contain a
bootable image?

A.

Hit "c" to enter GRUB command line.
(Hit Esc to return to GRUB boot menu at any time if desired.)

GRUB legacy:

find finds files using a path relative to the top level directory on
a partition.  Wildcards are not recognized.

grub> find /grub/grub.conf
(hd0,0)
This tells us that a /boot directory is present at (hd0,0), i.e. /dev/sda1

GRUB legacy numbers partitions starting at 0.
(GRUB 2 numbers partitions starting at 1.)

grub> cat (hd0,0)/grub/grub.conf
#
# GRUB file contents ....
#

GRUB 2:

GRUB 2 supports command completion, filename completion, and command history
like bash does.

search.file finds a file in a directory relative to the top level directory on
a partition.  Wildcards are not recognized.  The search is not recursive.

grub> search.file /grub2/grub.cfg
(hd0,msdos1)
This tells us that a /boot directory is present at (hd0,msdos1), i.e. /dev/sda1

GRUB 2 numbers partitions starting at 1.
(GRUB legacy numbers partitions starting at 0.)

ls shows all disk devices known to GRUB and their partitions.  Wildcards are
not recognized.

grub> ls
(proc) (hd0) (hd0,msdos1) (hd0,msdos2) .... 

grub> ls (hd0)
Device hd0: No known filesystem detected - Sector size 512B - Total size
26214400KiB

grub> ls (hd0,msdos1)
     Partition hd0.msdos1:  Filesystem type xfs, UUID abcd123-f23-bac-121 -
Partition start at 1024KiB - Total size 512000KiB

grub> ls (hd0,msdos1)/
vmlinuz-3.10.0-327.13.1.el7.x86_64 grub2/ initramfs-0-rescue ........

grub> cat (hd0,msdos1)/grub2/grub.cfg
#
# GRUB file contents ....
#

To view files on LVM volumes:

grub> insmod lvm
grub> ls  (LVM volumes as well as partitions should now appear)

*****

To see the values of all GRUB variables, including the "prefix" and "root"
variables that tell GRUB where to find GRUB stage 2 and the grub.cfg file,
type "set" at the GRUB shell prompt.

On BIOS machines with MBR-formatted disks, if /boot is a separate partition,
then the GRUB variables "prefix" and "root" have the form:

(hd0,msdos1)/grub2

On UEFI machines with GPT-formatted disks, if /boot/efi is a separate partition,
then the GRUB variables "prefix" and "root" have the form:

(hd6,gpt1)/EFI/redhat
