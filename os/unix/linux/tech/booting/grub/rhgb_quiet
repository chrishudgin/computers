The kernel command line parameters "rhgb" and "quiet" have the following
behaviors:

rhgb: Show plymouth graphical splash screen or ANSI graphics progress bar
instead of userland subsystem startup text messages.

quiet: Do not show kernel status messages during boot.  Userland subsystem
startup text messages are still displayed.
