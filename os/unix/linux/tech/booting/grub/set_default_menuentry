To set the default menuentry in grub.cfg:
# grub2-set-default 1  # sets the second menuentry to be the default

grub2-set-default modifies the variable "saved_entry" in the file grubenv that
resides in the same directory as grub.cfg.  By default, grub sets its own
"default" (menuentry) variable to the value of "saved_entry" when GRUB runs
at boot.

To specify an entry in grub.cfg by name to use as the default, use the full
title of the entry in grub.cfg as the argument to grub2-set-default.  For
example:

# grub2-set-default "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server (3.10.0-862.6.3.el7.x86_64) 7.5 (Maipo)"

Reset to the default behavior, which is to allow any newly installed kernel and
the most recent kernel already installed to set itself as the default boot
entry in grub.cfg:

BIOS:
# rm /boot/grub2/grubenv
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

EFI:
# rm /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubenv
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

The grub2-mkconfig command regenerates grubenv as well as grub.cfg.  A newly
generated grubenv does not have a "saved_entry" line.
