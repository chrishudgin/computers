To reinstall GRUB legacy from a GRUB command prompt (no menu available) on a
BIOS system (not UEFI) with /boot as a filesystem separate from the root FS:

grub> find /grub/grub.conf
(hd0,0)
grub> root (hd0,0)
grub> setup (hd0)
grub> cat (hd0,0)/grub/grub.conf

If grub.conf is missing or its contents are incorrect, enter GRUB configuration
lines by hand (tab completion is available for filenames):

grub> kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz...... (and remaining desired parameters)
grub> initrd (hd0,0)/initramfs.... (use complete filename)

grub> boot

Once system is booted, restore or correct /boot/grub/grub.conf.
