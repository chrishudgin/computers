If GRUB shell prompt appears instead of menu:

(Taken from https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#GRUB-only-offers-a-rescue-shell)

GRUB’s normal start-up procedure involves setting the ‘prefix’ environment
variable to a value set in the core image by grub-install, setting the ‘root’
variable to match, loading the ‘normal’ module from the prefix, and running the
‘normal’ command (see normal). This command is responsible for reading
/boot/grub/grub.cfg, running the menu, and doing all the useful things GRUB is
supposed to do.

If, instead, you only get a rescue shell, this usually means that GRUB failed
to load the ‘normal’ module for some reason. It may be possible to work around
this temporarily: for instance, if the reason for the failure is that ‘prefix’
is wrong (perhaps it refers to the wrong device, or perhaps the path to
/boot/grub was not correctly made relative to the device), then you can correct
this and enter normal mode manually:

# Inspect the current prefix (and other preset variables):
set
# Find out which devices are available:
ls
# Set to the correct value, which might be something like this:
set prefix=(hd0,1)/grub
set root=(hd0,1)
insmod normal
normal

*****

If grub.cfg is missing or corrupted, the "normal" command as described above
will have no effect.  To boot:

Manage scrolling of output:
grub> set pager=1

Determine the root disk:
grub> insmod lvm
grub> ls
grub> ls (hs0,msdos1)
grub> ls (hs0,msdos1)/
grub> ls (hd0,msdos2)
grub> ls (hd0,msdos2)/
(etc.)
If the root filesystem is on an LVM volume, make note of its name.
If the root filesystem is on a partition (not an LVM volume), make note of its
UUID.

Set root to the /boot partition:
grub> set root=(hd0,msdos1)

Set prefix to the directory that should contain grub.cfg:
grub> set prefix=(hd0,msdos1)/grub2

Set the kernel to boot.  Use tab completion for the vmlinuz filename located
in the directory specified by the "prefix" variable.
Root filesystem on LVM volume:
grub> linux16 /vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.6.3.el7.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/rhel_tester1-root ro
Root filesystem on partition:
grub> linux16 /vmlinuz-3.10.0-862.6.3.el7.x86_64 root=UUID=e737b971-6791-4a65-832e-eed27a7c8ce7 ro

Set the initrd to use.  Use tab completion for the initramfs filename.
grub> initrd16 /initramfs-3.10.0-862.6.3.el7.x86_64.img

Boot:
grub> boot

Once the system has booted, regenerate the grub.cfg.
