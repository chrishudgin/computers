MBR-formatted disk on BIOS machine:

Stage 1:

/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/boot.img (512 bytes) is used as the boot sector
(the Master Boot Record).  The boot sector is modified with the partition
table and the hardcoded starting disk address of core.img.

Stage 1.5:

core.img is generated by grub-mkimage and placed in /boot/grub2/i386-pc before
being copied to the disk by grub-install (which calls grub-bios-setup to
actually copy core.img onto the disk).

Once installed on a disk, core.img starts at sector 1 (not 0, which is the MBR)
and is able to extend up through sector 62 on a disk partitioned with DOS
compatibility mode turned on or sector 2047 on a disk partitioned with DOS
compatibility mode turned off.

core.img is typically a little less than 31K in size so that it will fit in the
31K of free space between the MBR and first partition on a DOS-partitioned disk.

core.img for a hard disk boot consists of /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/diskboot.img,
kernel.img, and any modules needed to access the filesystem containing
/boot/grub2.

Stage 2:

A collection of files in /boot/grub2, including grub.cfg, GRUB modules, and
fonts.

GPT-formatted disk on UEFI machine:

On a UEFI system, the firmware will load the UEFI boot menu and run the EFI
program specified for the selected boot entry.  On RHEL 7, that program is
/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI, which then loads the EFI program that runs
GRUB (/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi on RHEL 7).

Stages 1 and 1.5 are not needed with UEFI boot.

Stage 2 is located in the EFI System Partition, a FAT32 partition that Linux
mounts at /boot/efi.  On a RHEL 7 system, GRUB stage 2 is in
/boot/efi/EFI/redhat, which includes GRUB EFI programs and grub.cfg.
