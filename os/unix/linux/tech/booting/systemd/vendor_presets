Vendor presets determine whether a given systemd unit is enabled or disabled by
default.

Vendor preset settings are stored in files in /usr/lib/systemd/system-preset
and consist of enable/disable statements with service names (which can include
wildcards).  The RHEL 7 policy default is "disable" for all services except
those that are explicitly enabled.

A package's postinstall script may call "systemctl preset <servicename>" to
enable or disable the service provided by the package according to the vendor
preset value.
