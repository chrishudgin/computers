Mask a systemd service's unit configuration file so that once it is stopped, it
cannot be started by systemd again until it is subsequently unmasked:
# systemctl mask some.unit

Unmask it:
# systemctl unmask some.unit

Masking does not stop a running service, nor does it prevent a unit's
executable files from being run manually.

Masking can be used to indicate to users and administrators that a service
*should* not be started.
