At boot:
systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev.service runs, which runs:
   /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --prefix=/dev --create --boot
systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service runs, which runs:
   /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --create --remove --boot --exclude-prefix=/dev

15 minutes after boot and every 24 hours thereafter,
   systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer calls systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service,
   which runs:
   /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --clean

The --clean option to systemd-tmpfiles only processes rules that include a
   time interval in their specification (like 10d for 10 days)

Files are deleted only if their modification time, access time, and inode
   change time are all older than the specified time interval.

systemd-tmpfiles processes entries in configuration files
   {/usr/lib,/run,/etc}/tmpfiles.d/*.conf (from lowest to highest precedence)
Configuration file syntax is documented in tmpfiles.d(5).

Test the effects of a single customized configuration file:
# systemd-tmpfiles [options] /etc/tmpfiles.d/somefile.conf
