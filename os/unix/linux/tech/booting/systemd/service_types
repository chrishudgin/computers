systemd service types:

simple : daemon starts and is not expected to exit; sockets should be set up
   before daemon starts (as with a systemd socket unit)
   systemd will start dependent units as soon as daemon is started.

forking : parent process is expected to fork() and exit(); child is daemon.
   systemd will start dependent units as soon as the parent process exits.

oneshot : non-daemon process that performs an action and exits.
   systemd will start dependent units as soon as the process exits.
   (Compare to simple, above.)
   By default (that is, with the service's RemainAfterExit property set to no),
      systemd will run the service's ExecStart method, wait for it to exit,
      and then immediately run the service's ExecStop method.
   If RemainAfterExit=yes is set in the Service section of the service's unit
      file, then systemd will not run the service's ExecStop method until it is
      commanded to run.

notify : as with simple, but systemd will start dependent units once the
   process sends a notification to systemd.

idle : as with simple, but waits up to 5 seconds before starting to give
   other processes more time to finish writing to the console.
   Used for services like getty and rescue that generate console login prompts.
   Contrary to documentation, does NOT wait for all other jobs to start.
