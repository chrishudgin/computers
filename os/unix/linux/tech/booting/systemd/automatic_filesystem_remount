systemd will attempt to mount a filesystem automatically whenever its block
device changes from an unavailable state to an available state, unless the
filesystem has the "noauto" mount option set.

This means that if a filesystem is administratively unmounted and its block
device is made unavailable and then available again, systemd will immediately
remount the filesystem.

Rationale: A device may become available at any time, not just at boot, and any
filesystem that uses it might reasonably be expected to mount as soon as the
device becomes available.  systemd does not distinguish between devices
becoming available "at boot" versus any other time.
Reference: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6066

Note: Automatic mounting of a filesystem when its device becomes available
is a special case of dependent service startup.  If a generic service is
stopped and then restarted, its (stopped) dependent services are not normally
restarted automatically.

To prevent an immediate automatic remount from happening, use one of the
following methods after unmounting the filesystem:

Option 1. Mask the mount unit for the filesystem:

# systemctl mask some.mount

The block device can then be taken offline and online without an automatic
filesystem remount occurring.

When maintenance on the block device is finished, unmask the mount unit:
# systemctl unmask some.mount

Remount the filesystem if necessary.

Option 2. Comment out the filesystem's entry in /etc/fstab and then run:
# systemctl daemon-reload
to force systemd to re-read the contents of /etc/fstab.

The block device can then be taken offline and online without an automatic
filesystem remount occurring.

When maintenance on the block device is finished, uncomment the filesystem's
entry in /etc/fstab and run:
# systemctl daemon-reload

Remount the filesystem if necessary.
