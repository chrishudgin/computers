A systemd target is a grouping of units.

There are two types of targets--those that are used to define an
administratively selectable overall system state (i.e. those that can in
systemd terminology be "isolated") and those that are not.

Targets that can be isolated are the replacement for runlevels.

Targets that can be isolated have the target unit property "AllowIsolate" set
to "yes".

Examples:
network.target cannot be isolated
multi-user.target can be isolated

Attempting to boot via "systemd.unit=some.target" on the kernel command line to
a target that cannot be isolated will result in an incomplete startup with no
login prompt.
