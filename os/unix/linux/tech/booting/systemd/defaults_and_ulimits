When starting services, systemd does not apply any custom ulimit values set in
/etc/security/limits.{conf,d/*.conf}.  Instead, it uses default values for
ulimits and private systemd configuration variables, both of which
can be customized in /etc/systemd/system.{conf,conf.d/*.conf}.  The ulimits
set there apply to all services started by systemd.  The variables
listed in these files belong to the [Manager] configuration section and
have names prefixed by the word "Default", as in "DefaultLimitNOFILE".
The names of the drop-in files are arbitrary as long as they end in ".conf".

Example:

# cat /etc/systemd/system.conf.d/LimitNOFILE.conf
[Manager]
DefaultLimitNOFILE=65536

Further customization to ulimits on a per-service basis can be made by
creating custom unit files or drop-in unit configuration files with
the appropriate variables (minus the "Default" name prefix) in the [Service]
configuration section, as in this example for the lvm2-monitor.service:

# cat /etc/systemd/system/lvm2-monitor.service.d/LimitNOFILE.conf
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65536

Limits set in either of these ways (default or per-service) modify both the
hard and soft ulimits of the associated services' processes when they are
started through systemd.
