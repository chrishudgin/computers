systemd mount units are named according to their mount point directories, with
a - replacing each / after the first one in the path.  The root filesystem's
mount unit is a special case named "-.mount" in order for it not to have an
empty unit name component.

mount units can either be created dynamically at boot by systemd parsing
entries in /etc/fstab, or they can be created statically with mount unit
files.

Some systemd-specific mount unit parameters can be set in /etc/fstab to
customize mount behaviors.  One example is x-systemd.requires=<some.unit> which
sets Requires and After dependencies between the mount and a systemd unit.
Other options are documented in systemd.mount(5).

Filesystem entries in /etc/fstab are processed by systemd-fstab-generator(8) to
create mount unit files in memory dynamically.
