AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)

Provided by package "aide".

Configuration file is /etc/aide.conf, which configures which properties to
record and verify for which files and directories, optionally descending into
directories recursively for each directory specified.

Initialize database in /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz:
# aide --init

Rename the database file:
# mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz

As an additional precaution, consider copying the database file to another
machine or offline storage medium for safekeeping and future reference.

Check integrity of filesystem objects against values recorded in database:
# aide --check
