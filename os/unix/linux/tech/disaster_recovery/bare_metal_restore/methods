RHEL 7.2 and later include ReaR (Relax-and-Recover).

*****

To recover a system from a generic RHEL 7 installation ISO and xfsdumps stored
on an NFS server:

Boot to the ISO device.
With the installation option selected on the initial menu, hit Tab.
Add the kernel command line parameter "rescue" and hit Enter.
Select the option to start a shell.
Configure an IP address on the network interface:
   # ip address add 10.0.0.93/24 dev em1
Mount the NFS share that contains the xfsdumps:
   # mount -o ro 10.0.0.226:/archive /mnt

Use fdisk, mkfs, xfsrestore, and grub2-install to set up the new boot disk.
Edit /etc/fstab and /boot/grub2/grub.cfg on the new boot disk to ensure that
the UUIDs are correct, or use xfs_admin -U <device> to set the desired UUID for
each filesystem.
