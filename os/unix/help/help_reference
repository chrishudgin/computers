help (bash builtin):  Gives help on a bash builtin topic
    Example:  help echo

whatis / man -f:  Searches for man pages with the specified word as the
    title (Linux) or in the title and one-line description (Unix).
    The "whatis" database is created by the "makewhatis" command.

apropos / man -k:  Searches man page titles and one-line descriptions for a
     string, not a word, including strings that might be part of longer words
     apropos -l : do not truncate lines of output
     mandb (Linux) : create man page indexes for searching with man -k
        updates indexes in /var/cache/man
        On RHEL 7, mandb runs daily through anacron in
           /etc/cron.daily/man-db.cron

locate:  Searches for a string in a database created by updatedb that
    contains all file names on the system and returns matches for files and
       directories that are in the database and still exist
    locate command uses database /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db updated daily by
       the updatedb command through /etc/cron.daily/mlocate
    a user running locate will see results only for those files in directories
       in and under which they have read permission (so an unprivileged user
       running locate will see the /root directory itself listed but not its
       contents like /root/.bashrc).
    locate -i : case-insensitive search

type:  Displays the type of a command--alias, function, shell builtin,
    or path to executable (in bash, also states whether the path is hashed)
type -a : Shows all matches for the type of a command, not just the first

which:  Displays first path found to command; ignores shell builtins and
    displays only filesystem paths
alias | which --read-alias  # includes aliases for command, not just paths
which -a : list all paths to command, not just the first
whereis:  Displays binary, source, and man page location for command; searches standard list of directories for executables, not $PATH

man:  Displays full man page entry

info or pinfo:  Display info page
   Without any options, info or pinfo will open a list (info's "directory") of
      all installed info pages
   info pages are kept in /usr/share/info
      If an info page for a topic does not exist, info displays the man page.
   Type 'h' for help within info
   <Space> : move forward one screen
   <DEL> : move backward one screen
   Type 'l' to return to the last node visited in the info page.
   Tip:  [ and ] or "n" and "p" can be used to scroll between "nodes"
      (sections) in an info document even when the DEL (or Backspace) key is
      mapped to Ctrl-H (which brings up the "Help" pages for info)

command --help : Shows syntax and brief usage notes for command
