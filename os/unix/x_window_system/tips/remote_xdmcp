To connect to a remote XDMCP server from the command line, use the Xephyr
command.

Example can be found at:

http://jeffskinnerbox.me/posts/2014/Apr/29/howto-using-xephyr-to-create-a-new-display-in-a-window/

Xephyr :3 -ac -screen 1280x1024 -br -reset -terminate -query foobox 2> /dev/null &   (where "foobox" is the hostname of the remote XDMCP server in this example)

Or just use VNC

Q. Why can't we tunnel XDMCP over ssh?
A. Tunneling over ssh requires that the tunneled protocol use TCP, but XDMCP
uses UDP.
