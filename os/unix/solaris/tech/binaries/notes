RPATH/RUNPATH can be overridden with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64,
but not if the executable is setuid and being run as a user other than the
owner.  In that case, the LD variables are ignored.  A trusted library path
can be added to /var/ld/ld.config if necessary using the "crle -s" command.
