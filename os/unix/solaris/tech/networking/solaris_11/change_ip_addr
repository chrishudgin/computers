To change an IP address for an interface (interface net0 in this example):

ipadm delete-addr net0/v4  # This permanently deletes all IPv4 addresses that
    were configured on net0
ipadm create-addr -T static -a 10.0.0.68/8 net0/v4

If necessary, to set the default route:
route -p add default 10.0.0.1

If necessary, to recreate default IPv6 address on an interface:
ipadm create-addr -T addrconf net0/v6
