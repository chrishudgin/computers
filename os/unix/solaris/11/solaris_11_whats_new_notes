Installation and boot
---------------------

Automated Installer replaces JumpStart and can provision Solaris 11 zones.

Image Packaging System (IPS) uses network repositories.

For certain package updates, IPS creates a ZFS clone of the boot environment
and updates the clone to allow safe application and backout of the update.

IPS has automatic dependency checking.

Fast reboot bypasses certain system and firmware checks when enabled:
SMF service system/boot-config:default, property config/fastreboot_default

SVR4 packages can still be installed, but not patched.

Some services' configurations have been moved from /etc to SMF.

Examples
include svc:/system/name-service/switch replacing /etc/nsswitch.conf and
svc:/network/dns/client incorporating /etc/resolv.conf.  nscfg utility
can migrate name service configs to and from SMF.

Also nodename and defaultdomain have been moved to svc:/system/identity:node
and svc:system/identity:domain.

/etc/default/init has been moved into svc:/environment:init

Driver configuration files have been moved to /etc/driver/drv.
prtconf -u to show driver configs.

sysconfig replaces sys-unconfig and sysidtool.

Zones
-----

Solaris 10 local zones are supported.

By default, zones are exclusive-IP with a virtual NIC called net0.
Virtual NICs are configured in zonecfg with the "anet" property.

zoneadm shutdown command

zonestat utility

RBAC
----

root account is now an RBAC role.
Admin can control whether user password or role password is used to access
a role.  Newly created roles require user password by default.

Network virtualization throughout the network stack.

dlstat shows performance statistics for network data links.

IPMP
----

ipadm now manages IPMP configuration.

IPMP transitive probing allows probes to router without the use of test
IP addresses (feature disabled by default):
# svccfg -s svc:/network/ipmp setprop config/transitive-probing=true
# svcadm refresh svc:/network/ipmp:default

in.mpathd is now managed by SMF service svc:/network/ipmp


Storage
-------

Root filesystem is ZFS.

ZFS filesystems other than those in the root pool can be encrypted.

Deduplication can be enabled per ZFS filesystem, with deduplication performed
across all filesystems in a pool that have deduplication enabled.

ZFS shadow migration to live-migrate from one filesystem to another and enable
the new FS once finished.

ZFS temporary mountpoints (zfs mount -o mountpoint=...)

ZFS snapshot diffs can be viewed (changed files and directories).

User tools
----------

GNU commands are in /usr/bin or /usr/gnu/bin.

ksh93 is included.

"man -K string" to search for "string" in man pages.
SMF:  svc:/application/man-index

ZFS graphical time slider snapshot management for home directories.

Printing is now done by CUPS.
