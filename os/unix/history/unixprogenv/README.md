Chapter notes and solutions to exercises from the book _The UNIX Programming
Environment_ by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, published by Prentice-Hall in 1984.  Notes
and solutions are my own and are not official in any respect.

Solutions have been tested on 7th Edition UNIX (1979) running in the SIMH
PDP-11 emulator as well as on macOS 13 and Raspberry Pi OS 11.

I have no affiliation with the authors of the book or its publisher.
