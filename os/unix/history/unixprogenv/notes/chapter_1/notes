Ctrl-D flushes the input buffer--i.e. it sends the current line of input to
the program reading the terminal (for example, the shell).  If the current
line of input is empty, then the reading program gets EOF.  When the shell
reads EOF, it exits.  Ctrl-D differs from <newline> because Ctrl-D does not
send a newline character before it flushes the input buffer.

mesg simply sets the "write" permission bit for the tty group on your tty
   device file.  The "write" command is setgid tty.

echo -n suppresses the trailing newline in some shells like bash, but not sh
   or ksh.  For those shells, suppress a newline with:  echo "string\c"

1.2

sort -f  # fold upper and lower case when sorting
sort -d  # dictionary order--only letters, digits, and blanks are considered
sort -u  # print only one line from each set of duplicated lines
sort -o filename   # save output in filename 
sort +n  # skip n fields and start sorting at the n+1st field

tail +n  # starts ouput at the nth line
tail -r  # prints output lines in reverse order

1.4

& at the end of a pipeline applies to the whole pipeline (the whole pipeline
   is started in the background).  However, the shell only prints the PID of
   the last command in the pipeline.

wait   # waits until all processes started with & have finished

kill 0  # kills background processes (all processes in the process group
        # except the initiating shell)
