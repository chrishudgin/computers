This program can be used to test for filesystem uniformity as described in the
footnote of section 2.2 of the book _The UNIX Programming Environment_ by
Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike:

"There's a good test of file system uniformity, due originally to Doug Mellroy,
that the UNIX file system passes handily. Can the output of a FORTRAN program
be used as input to the FORTRAN compiler? A remarkable number of systems have
trouble with this test."

To verify that a Unix or Unix-like system with a Fortran 77 compiler passes
this test, run the following commands:

$ rm -f fstest hello hello.f
$ f77 -o fstest fstest.f
$ ./fstest > hello.f
$ f77 -o hello hello.f
$ ./hello
hello, world

If the commands complete successfully and the "hello" program prints the
expected string "hello, world", then the Unix filesystem passes the uniformity
test.
