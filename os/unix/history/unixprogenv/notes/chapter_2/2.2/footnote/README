This program is a test of filesystem uniformity as given in the footnote of
section 2.2 of the book _The UNIX Programming Environment_ by Brian Kernighan
and Rob Pike:

"There's a good test of file system uniformity, due originally to Doug Mellroy,
that the UNIX file system passes handily. Can the output of a FORTRAN program
be used as input to the FORTRAN compiler? A remarkable number of systems have
trouble with this test."

To verify that a Unix or Unix-like system with a Fortran 77 compiler passes
this test, run the following commands:

$ rm -f fstest hello hello.f
$ f77 -o fstest fstest.f
$ ./fstest > hello.f
$ f77 -o hello hello.f
$ ./hello
hello, world

Alternatively, the output of the FORTRAN program can be used as input to the
FORTRAN compiler through a pipe, if the compiler can accept source code from
standard input.  The following example works with the GNU FORTRAN compiler:

$ (f77 -o fstest fstest.f; ./fstest) | (f77 -x f77 -o hello -; ./hello)
hello, world

(Notably, Doug McIlroy was the inventor of the Unix pipe.)

If the commands complete successfully and the "hello" program prints the
expected string "hello, world", then the Unix filesystem passes the uniformity
test.
