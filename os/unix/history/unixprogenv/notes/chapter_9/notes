9.1

.I with no argument switches the font to italic until a subsequent directive
(if any) changes it.

"Display" text is text that should not be filled and justified according to the
normal rules, if at all (no filling or justification is the default behavior
for display text).  troff will keep text in a .DS/.DE macro pair together,
placing it on a separate page if necessary to do so.

The ms macro package renders the second argument to the .B and .I commands in
roman text, but the man macro package lacks this feature.  The \fB, \fI, and
\fR troff commands can be used instead.

9.2

The .CW macro takes two arguments so that the second, if supplied, will be
rendered in the previous font.  This macro syntax mirrors that of the .I and
.B macros that are part of the ms macro package.

9.4

The default action for the man command in Linux is to print (display) only
the first man page found with the specified name, not all matching man pages.

The hoc(1) man page source file, hoc.1, is not included in the files
distributed online for the book.  However, the complete source for hoc.1 is
printed in the book in Figure 9.1.  To generate a PostScript version of this
man page that matches the document in Figure 9.2 (minus the "8th Edition"
footer), run:

$ man -t ./hoc.1 > hoc.1.ps
