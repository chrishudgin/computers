Due to changes in the usage modes of time-sharing systems and the pervasiveness
of communication methods like text messaging, collaboration applications,
instant messaging apps, RSS feeds, and email on smart phones and personal
computers, applications like "news" whose message contents are managed on the
host by the host's system administrators for direct, interactive consumption at
a terminal are no longer commonly used on Unix and Unix-like computers.

However, AIX and Linux still have a "news" command with the same functional
design as the "news" script from the book but with additional features.  On
Linux, the "news" command from the "sysnews" package is written in
approximately 600 lines of C (thirty times the size of the simple "news" script
in the book).  It supports more options than the "news" script, such as flags
to show all news items, show a summary of items instead of their contents, and
(for maintainers) to expire older items.

The Linux sysnews software was last updated in 1997, an indication of its
obsolescence decades later.

For host-specific messages to users, /etc/motd can also still be used, though
this does not give the user the ability (as the "news" script does) to treat a
message as "read" so that it will not be displayed again.
