The : character is a shell command, albeit a command that does nothing except
evaluate its arguments (after substitution) and return true.  It must therefore
be used only in places where a shell command is syntactically valid, and can be
used as a placeholder to fulfill a syntax requirement where no side effects are
desired--for example, constituting the predicate of a "while" loop or as a
no-operation clause in a compound if/then/else statement.  The ":" command can
optionally be followed by text meant as a comment, but when it is used to
protect comment text it must still be placed only in a context where a shell
command is valid.

An unquoted # comment character and any text that follows it are ignored by the
shell, except for the special construction #!... which may appear as a shell
invocation at the start of a script.  The comment character does not function
as a command or even a placeholder for one, and as a non-command it cannot
return a value.

The ":" command is not strictly needed since its function can be performed by
the "true" command or the "true" shell built-in.  The "#" comment character is
also not strictly required and was not even recognized by the shell as late as
Unix Version 7.  However, due to their differing characteristics described
above, the : and # characters cannot generally be used as substitutes for each
other.
