Deleting an entry from the middle of the history file (not the first or last
entry) requires only deleting the summary line "@@@ ..." for that entry from
the history file.  Although the summary comments describing the removed version
will be lost, the corresponding ed edits will remain in the history file.  The
ed edits for the deleted version and for the version that was prior to it will
thus be concatenated into a single command sequence which can still be applied
by the "get" command to retrieve earlier versions of the file.
