Deleting an entry from the middle of the history file (not the first or last
entry) requires only deleting the summary line "@@@ ..." for that entry from
the history file.  Although the summary comments describing the removed version
will be lost, the corresponding ed edits will remain in the file.  This
effectively joins the ed edits for the change prior to the deleted version and
for the deleted version into a single command sequence, with an identical
cumulative result on the file contents.
