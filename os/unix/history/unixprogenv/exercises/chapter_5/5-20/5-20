As it is now written, the "replace" script cannot safely change a variable "i"
to "index" everywhere in a program unless the letter "i" does not appear
anywhere except as the variable of that name (a scenario that is highly
unlikely).  Any instance of the letter "i" in the program source file would be
changed to "index", whether or not that instance was, in fact, being used to
denote the variable called "i".  Thus, comments, literal strings, other
variable names that contained "i" in them, and keywords would all be affected
by the replacement of "i" with "index".

Distinguishing a variable in a program from another identical string of
characters that is not a variable requires the ability to establish the context
of a string--specifically, whether it is being used as a variable or not at a
point it appears in a program source file.  Separating variables from other
text is the job of lexers and parsers, programs that are far more complex than
the simple "replace" script.
