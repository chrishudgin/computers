Since the "which" script is a child of the shell process that created it, it
cannot modify the environment variables of its parent shell process.  The
parent shell's value of $PATH remains unaltered throughout the invocation,
execution, and exit of the the child shell process that runs the "which"
script.  There is therefore no need for the "which script" to reset the value
of PATH to opath before exiting.
