The "which" script, being a child of the shell process that created it, cannot
modify the environment variables of its parent shell process.  The parent
shell's value of PATH remains unaltered throughout the invocation, execution,
and exit of the the child shell process that runs the "which" script.  There is
therefore no need for the "which script" to reset the value of PATH to opath
before exiting; any changes to the value of PATH made by the "which" script are
isolated to itself and its own child processes.
