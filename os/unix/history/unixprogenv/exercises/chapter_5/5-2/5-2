Although inexperienced users may naively enter a two-digit year expecting it to
yield a calendar in the 20th or 21st century, changing the cal command to
process two-digit years specially would result in a user interface to cal that
is inconsistent.  Users who intended to see a calendar for the years between 1
and 99, in the first century, would need to enter such dates in a non-standard
way, perhaps by prepending the year with a 0 or by calling cal with an
additional flag.  Such special treatment of one or two digit years would
require changes to the cal command itself and would complicate usage of the
command.

Special treatment for one- or two-digit years so that they are interpreted as
years in the 20th or 21st century, if desired, might better be accomplished
with a wrapper to the cal command instead of making changes to cal itself.
