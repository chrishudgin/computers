With signal 0 (any shell exit) added to the list of trapped signals, if an
interrupt (signal 2) is received, the trap handler will execute its programmed
commands (removing files and running exit) due to the interrupt, then run the
same trap handler code again due to the shell exit (signal 0).  Consequently,
an interrupt signal will cause a superfluous second run of the file removal
command.

Moreover, the trap handler to remove files and exit with a status of 1 will run
every time the script runs to normal completion, not just when the script is
interrupted or aborted.  An exit status of 1 is undesirable for a normal shell
exit since by convention it denotes an error condition.
