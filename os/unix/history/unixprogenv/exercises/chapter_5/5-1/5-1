In order for a program to be not only globally accessible but convenient for
users to access, it should be placed in a directory that has global read and
execute permissions and that is part of the standard PATH for users, such as
/usr/bin.  Placing a program in a /usr/bin requires superuser privileges, since
/usr/bin is owned by a system account such as root or bin and is not globally
writable.  Commands requiring superuser privileges can be run in a shell
started by the "su" command, which requires that the root password be entered.

Since the version of cal presented in the book is a wrapper for the standard
version of cal in /bin or /usr/bin, the script must not overwrite the standard
cal executable or else the script will not function.  If both the standard cal
executable and the cal script are to reside in the same directory, one of them
must be renamed.  If the standard executable is renamed, then the script must
be modified to call the standard executable by its new name.  If the script is
renamed, users must be told to use the new name of the script in order to
access it.
