Combining standard output and standard error can make it difficult for a user
to distinguish a command's normal operating messages from its error
diagnostics.

Separating standard output and standard error in the nohup script can be done
by replacing the redirection directive "2>&1" with something like
"2>>nohup.err" when nohup is run from a terminal and simply removing the "2>&1"
directive from the command invocation when nohup is not run from a terminal.
In the latter case, the invoked command would be expected to handle its own
redirection of standard output and standard error, as a non-interactive command
typically does anyway.
