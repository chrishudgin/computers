Attempting to infer a user's intent in special cases (like asking for January's
calendar in December) when a month is specified to cal without a year is likely
to result, in some situations, in output that the user did not expect--such as
when a user intends to view a past month's calendar in the current year instead
of a future month's calendar in the subsequent year.

Adding more and more special case processing to try to anticipate and avoid
users' potential mistakes or misunderstandings inevitably complicates commands
that are intended to be simple both to implement and to use.  Special case
"intent" processing also frustrates experienced users who are comfortable with
the regular, predictable input forms that commands expect and who in turn
expect consistent results from regular forms of input.
