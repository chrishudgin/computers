Use the "which" script or command to locate the "true" and "false" commands:

$ which true
/bin/true

$ which false
/bin/false

The /bin/true command on Version 7 Unix is implemented as an executable empty
file, which when executed returns an exit code of 0.

The /bin/false command on Version 7 Unix is implemented as a shell script that
exits with an exit code of 1 by calling the shell built-in command "exit" with
an argument of "1":

$ cat /bin/false
exit 1
