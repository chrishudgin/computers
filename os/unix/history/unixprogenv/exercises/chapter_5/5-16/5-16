Adding a user to the system requires permissions to edit /etc/passwd,
/etc/shadow (if applicable), /etc/group, and related files; create and populate
a directory with correct ownership and permissions in /home (or /usr in older
versions of Unix); and create a mail spool file with correct ownership and
permissions in /var/spool/mail or /usr/spool/mail.  Superuser permissions will
cover all of these requirements.

Ideally, a program that adds a user account should handle interrupts by
ensuring that any newly created account components are removed.  This means
removing all of the following if they were freshly created:  the home
directory, the mail spool file, the account's entry in /etc/passwd and in
related files like /etc/shadow, and references to the account in /etc/group.
