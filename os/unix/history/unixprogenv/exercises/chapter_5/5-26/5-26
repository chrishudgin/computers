A .profile for 7th Edition UNIX could include commands like the following to
set a user's TERM variable and set tabs appropriately for it:

echo -n "TERM? "
read TERM
tabs $TERM

Modern versions of Unix-like operating systems have a "tabs" command that
requires a different syntax, as in the following example to set a tab stop
every 8 characters for a terminal of type $TERM:

tabs -8 -T $TERM
