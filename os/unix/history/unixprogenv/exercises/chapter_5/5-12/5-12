The version of watchwho that uses shell variables instead of temporary files
has the advantages of not having to do storage I/O to manage the files (meaning
it could potentially run faster) and of not leaving temporary files in the
filesystem after the script exits (which should be cleaned up).

On a Unix system with a single text-mode terminal per user, it would be useful
to run watchwho or checkmail in the background with & so that the user could
perform other tasks while being periodically notified of logins/logouts and new
mail.  The disadvantage of this technique would be that the notifications would
appear on the user's terminal screen regardless of what application the user
was running in the foreground (such as a text editor or document viewer),
overwriting existing displayed text.

On modern systems with bitmapped graphics displaying multiple pseudo-terminal
sessions, running watchwho and checkmail in the background would not be
necessary, since one or more dedicated terminal sessions could be opened for
these tools.  With their own dedicated session or sessions, these scripts would
not interfere with text displayed in other terminal sessions whenever
notifications appeared.
