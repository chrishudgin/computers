Shortcomings of this simple spelling checker include:

Words that are capitalized in /usr/dict/words will appear in the output as if
they are misspelled, even if they are capitalized identically (and correctly)
in the input.  This is due to a limitation in the comm(1) utility.  This
limitation could be addressed by adding a special case to check for words in
the input with capital letters, eliminating words that have only an initial
capital and start a sentence (which would be assumed to be valid), and then
doing an exact case-sensitive match in /usr/dict/words.

Nonsensical single letters following a punctuation mark, such as in

	file't
	act,y

will not appear in the output even though they should.  This happens because
the spelling checker replaces punctuation with newlines and /usr/dict/words
considers any single letter to be a valid word.  The advantage of this approach
is that valid possessives like

	file's

(as in "the file's permissions") will not produce output unnecessarily.  Fixing
the above limitation could be handled by adding more special case checks like
for an apostrophe followed immediately by a letter other than "s", or for
single letters that are not themselves valid words.

Plurals (such as "birds") are not handled properly because they do not appear
in /usr/dict/words.  Fixing this limitation without altering /usr/dict/words
would be challenging, because different words have different plural forms, and
only nouns can be plural.  The file /usr/dict/words has no provision for
identifying a part of speech for each word found in it, but a more
sophisticated dictionary could, allowing for automated (though still imperfect)
checks of plural noun forms.
