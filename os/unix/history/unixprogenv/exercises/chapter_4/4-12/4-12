A user's intent when placing dates within a line could be ambiguous.  It would
not be clear whether the dates are meant to refer to events for the calendar or
are simply notes for the user within the text of calendar events.  A regular
input format is clearer and easier to process.

A date format that contains the year as well as the month and day would be more
flexible since it would resolve amiguity about the year when calendar entries
are intended to span multiple years.
