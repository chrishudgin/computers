The verification pipeline for prpages (pr piped to awk) is slightly slower than
the version of prpages that is implemented with wc piped to awk, probably due
to the overhead of the pr command as it not only counts lines but also formats
documents in memory.  Using expr or shell arithmetic $(( )) to do the
arithmetic instead of awk does not affect the running time.  About half the
running time is taken up by pr, the rest mostly due to process spawning and
pipelining rather than the arithmetic division operation.
