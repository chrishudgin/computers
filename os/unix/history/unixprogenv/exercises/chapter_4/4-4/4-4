The word counting pipeline is slower (about three times as long to run) but
shorter (4 lines versus 26) and easier to maintain than wordcount.py, as long
as the existing Unix shell commands provide the functionality needed when piped
together.

Converting wordcount.py to a spell checker would require the following
modifications:

- Read the input words, convert them to lower case, and add them to a list
   rather than a Python dictionary data structure since word counts are no
   longer needed

- Open a file with a list of known words (a "dictionary" in the conventional
   sense of the word), read it into its own list, then close the file

- For each word in input list, search word dictionary for it; if not found,
   print it
