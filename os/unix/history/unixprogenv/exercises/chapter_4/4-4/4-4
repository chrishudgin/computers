The word counting pipeline is slower (about three times as long to run) but
shorter (4 lines versus 26) and easier to maintain than wordcount.py, as long
as the existing Unix shell commands provide the functionality needed when piped
together.

Converting wordcount.py to a spell checker would require the following
modifications:

- Read the input words into a list rather than a Python dictionary data
   structure since word counts are no longer needed

- Open a file with a list of known words (a "dictionary" in the conventional
   sense of the word) and read it into its own list

- For each word in input list, convert it to lower case and search word
   dictionary for it; if not found, print it

- Close dictionary of known words
