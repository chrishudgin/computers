If a regular expression could match newlines (and hence multiple lines), then
it would be more efficient (and less confusing for the user) for grep to
advance past any multi-line match before scanning another input line.
Otherwise, the potential would exist for a given line to appear multiple times
for a single pattern match.

For example, with regular expressions able to match newlines (e.g. with \n)
but *without* multi-line advance after each multi-line match:

$ cat inputfile
abc
def
ghi
jkl

$ grep '...\n...\n' inputfile
abc
def
def
ghi
ghi
jkl

Two lines at a time would be matched, and the second line thus matched each
time would be matched again as the first line in the following scan.
