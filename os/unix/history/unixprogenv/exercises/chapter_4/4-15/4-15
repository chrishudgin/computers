Headers used for summarizing data or providing titles to columns are helpful
when commands are used interactively on a terminal, but they can be a slight
impediment to scripted extraction of data since the format of the first line
(the header) does not match the format of subsequent lines and must therefore
be handled differently or removed before further processing, as for example by
piping data through "sed 1d".
