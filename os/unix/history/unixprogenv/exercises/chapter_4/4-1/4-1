Searching for palindromes with grep could be done as follows, with each pattern
matching a different word length:

Three letter words:
$ grep '\(.\).\1'

Four letter words:
$ grep '^\(.\)\(.\)\2\1$'

Five letter words:
$ grep '^\(.\)\(.\).\2\1$'

Six letter words:
$ grep '^\(.\)\(.\)\(.\)\3\2\1$'

Seven letter words:
$ grep '^\(.\)\(.\)\(.\).\3\2\1$'

Etc.
