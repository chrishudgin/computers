For security reasons, it is no longer recommended to include the current
directory in PATH.  However, if the user understands the risks, then placing
the current directory at the beginning of PATH is usually what is desired since
it will allow the user to run custom or private versions of commands
preferentially instead of commands in the standard PATH search directories that
have the same names.
