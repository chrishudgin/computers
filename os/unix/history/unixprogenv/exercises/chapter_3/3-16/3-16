Since the entire pipeline (including the "for" loop) is placed in the
background, it cannot take input from the terminal and any "read" command will
be suspended.  The shell will return to a normal shell prompt, print the first
"pick" prompt, and wait for another command to be entered.  If the user
responds to the "pick" prompt with "y" or "n", the shell will interpret the
response as a request to run a command named "y" or "n" and the request will
fail unless there happens to be a program with one of those names in the PATH.
