On 7th Edition UNIX, the following command will identify how many commands in
/bin and /usr/bin are actually shell files:

$ file /bin/* /usr/bin/* | grep "commands text" | wc -l
12

(Note that 7th Edition UNIX has a /bin directory but not /usr/bin)

On other Unix-like operating systems, the search pattern passed to grep would
need to be modified to match the string output by the "file" command when
encountering a shell script or other text file (such as "ASCII text").

While the average size of a binary executable is substantially larger than that
of a typical shell script and most guesses of file type based on file size
would correctly distinguish the two, guesses based on file length should not be
considered reliable since some binary executables are very small (especially on
early Unix versions for PDP-11 hardware), and shell scripts are occasionally
quite large.
