$ echo `echo `date``
date

There are two backtick-quoted strings in the command line above:
`echo `
and
``

`echo ` produces a blank, which when run as a command through command
substitution does nothing and produces nothing.

The empty string `` when processed as a command though command substitution
also does nothing and produces nothing.

After command substitution, the resulting command line is:

$ echo date

which simply prints the string "date".
