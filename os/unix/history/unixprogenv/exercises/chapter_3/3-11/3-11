$ `date`
Mon: not found

The command "date" is run; then, its output is run as a command by the shell
through command substitution.

The "date" command produces output like the following:

$ date
Mon Oct  3 02:45:21 EDT 1988

When this output is then run as a command, Unix searches for but does not find
a command called "Mon" (or "Tue", etc.).  This produces an error message like
the one shown above.
