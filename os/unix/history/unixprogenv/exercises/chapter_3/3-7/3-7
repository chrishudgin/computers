$ cat x y >y

The shell detects that an output file is also an input file, writes an error
message ("input file is output file"), and stops processing the command line
input before overwriting the output file or running the command.

Without such error checking by the shell, this command might cause the shell to
create (if necessary) and empty the file y before running the cat command.  cat
would then copy the contents of x and y into y, but since y would now be empty,
y would receive only the contents of x.

$ cat x >>x

Again, the shell will detect that an output file is also an input file and will
write an error message and stop processing the command line before overwriting
the output file or running the command.

Without such error checking by the shell, this command might cause the shell to
append the contents of file x to itself, duplicating the existing content in
the file.
