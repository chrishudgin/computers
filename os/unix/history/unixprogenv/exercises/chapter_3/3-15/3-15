Placing the "pick" command in the shell file would make the "diff" loop less
generally applicable and would force the script to be interactive as the user
would always have to select files one by one for comparison.  A better solution
would be to make the filename arguments to the shell file with the diff loop
fully general (as with "for i in $*"), allowing the user to pipe a list of
filenames to the diff script and then further pipe the results of the diff
script to pr and/or lpr if desired.
