.* as a filename pattern will match any file or directory beginning with a dot
(.), regardless of the characters (if any) that follow the dot and regardless
of whether the pattern matches a filename or a directory name.

The current directory always contains an entry called "." for itself and an
entry called ".." for the current directory's parent directory.

ls without any options will list the names of files and directories that match
the given pattern.

Thus, "ls .*" will output a listing of names of files and directories as
follows:

Any files in the current directory whose names begin with a dot, such as a file named .profile

The contents of the current directory .

The contents of the parent directory ..

The contents of any subdirectory of the current directory whose name begins
with a dot, such as .configdir
