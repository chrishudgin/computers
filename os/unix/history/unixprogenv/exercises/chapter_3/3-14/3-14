The original version of 411 separates the code ("grep $*") from the data (a
file called /usr/you/lib/phone-book).  This is considered to be good practice
except when code and data must be packaged together, such as in a
self-extracting file (as with a shell script wrapper for a here document).

The here-document version of 411 could be slightly easier to maintain for
casual use since it doesn't require the user to look up a second file where the
data is stored.  However, the phone book file could be useful for other
programs besides 411, and those other programs would be easier to write and
maintain with the code for 411 separated from the data that those programs wish
to use or modify since there would be no special case required for processing
the first and last lines of the 411 file (the "grep" command and the
end-of-file marker, respectively).  Thus, for a general service, the original
version of 411 is preferable.
