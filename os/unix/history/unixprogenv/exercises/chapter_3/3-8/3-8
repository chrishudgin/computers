rm can't warn you that you are about to delete all your files if you run

$ rm *

because the shell expands * into a list of file and directory names before
passing that list to the rm command.  Hence, rm never sees the * argument and
therefore does not know you are passing it the complete list of files and
directories (other than those whose names start with a dot) in your current
directory.
