To tell grep to search for a pattern beginning with a '-', use the -e option to
grep followed by the search pattern.

For example:

grep -e -abc somefile

Quoting an argument beginning with a dash is not sufficient to pass grep a
search pattern beginning with a dash because the shell will remove the quotes
around the argument before passing it to grep.  grep will then see the argument
beginning with a dash (without surrounding quotes) and will attempt to process
it as a set of options instead of as a search pattern.
