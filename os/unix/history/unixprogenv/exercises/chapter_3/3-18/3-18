The bundle script does not work well for bundling binary files since it
implicitly assumes the character before the "End of file" here document
delimiter that it inserts at the end of the bundled file content is a newline
(so that the here document delimiter string can start on a new line).

The ar(1) program can archive binary or text files equally well since it treats
all files as binary.  ar also records and sets a file's timestamp, UID/GID, and
file permissions; bundle does not.

The bundle script is a text file and can be run without modification on any
Unix platform; ar is a binary executable that must be recompiled (and possible
modified for porting before recompilation) before being able to run on other
Unix platforms.

ar(1) allows files to be added to, removed from, and replaced in an archive
after the initial archive is created; bundle does not have these capabilities
(bundles can only be extracted or copied intact after they are made).
