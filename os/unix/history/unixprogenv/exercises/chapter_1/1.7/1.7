$ who | sort

causes the shell to create a pipeline between the "who" command and the "sort"
command, both of which commands then run simultaneously so that the standard
output of the "who" comamnd is received as the standard input of the "sort"
command.  The result is that the list of users output by "who" is sorted and
then printed to the screen by "sort".

$ who > sort

causes the shell to create or overwrite (empty) a file in the current directory
called "sort", then run the "who" command with its standard output redirected
to that file.  The result is that the list of users output by the "who" command
is placed into a file called "sort".  The list is not sorted because the "sort"
command was not given on the command line and was therefore not run.
