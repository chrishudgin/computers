The backslash (escape character) will prevent the @ character from being
interpreted as a line kill, so a new shell prompt with empty command line will
not appear immediately.  However, when <Enter> is pressed, the shell will look
for a command called "date@" in the current path and will not find it:

$ date\@
date@: command not found

On modern Unix-like operating systems, the line kill character is typically
Ctrl-U, which will still operate normally as a line kill even if the previous
character is a backslash (escape character).
