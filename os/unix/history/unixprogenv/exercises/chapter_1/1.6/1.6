The shell first creates or overwrites the file called "temp", then runs the wc
command with the filename argument "temp" with its output redirected to a (now
empty) file of that name.  Since the file "temp" processed by wc is empty by
the time wc runs, it records that the file has 0 lines, 0 words, and 0 bytes
and places that information into the file.  The file then therefore same
contains the following content:

0 0 0 temp

Misspelling a command name means no command will be run, and hence no command
will write to the file specified by the redirection operator.  However, since
redirection is done by the shell (including creating or emptying the file
specified) before the shell attempts to run the command, the file "temp" will
exist and be empty when the shell finishes processing the command line.  The
shell will print an error message to the standard error stream (usually the
screen) indicating that the command was not found:

$ woh > temp
woh: command not found
