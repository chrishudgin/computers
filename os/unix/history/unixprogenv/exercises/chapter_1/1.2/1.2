$ date
Mon Sep 26 12:39:56 EDT 1983

This is the normal output of the "date" command.

$ #date
Mon Sep 26 12:40:21 EDT 1983

The erase character is intercepted and interpreted by the kernel before it
can be interpreted as a comment character by the shell.  Since nothing
precedes the erase character on the command line, nothing is erased.  The
shell then sees only the date command and runs it.

$ \#date

There is no output because the backslash (escape character) prevents the
kernel from interpreting the following character, which is the shell comment
character.  The shell then sees a command preceded by the comment character,
so it interprets the command as a comment and does nothing.

$ \\#date
#date: not found

The first backslash escapes the second one, causing the second one to be sent
as a literal backslash to the shell.  The shell then sees a backslash followed
by the comment character; since the comment character is escaped, it is not
treated as the beginning of a comment and instead is left as-is on the command
line.  The shell then tries to run the resulting command #date, which is not
found.
