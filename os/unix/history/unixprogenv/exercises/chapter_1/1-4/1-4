$ ls junk

If there is a file called junk in the current directory, the ls command will
show its name.  If there is a subdirectory called junk in the current
directory, the ls command will list the names of its files and subdirectories,
if the user has permission to view the contents of the directory "junk".

$ ls /

This lists the names of the files and directories that are in the root
directory (but does not recurse into subdirectories).

$ ls

This lists the names of the files and directories in the current directory.

$ ls *

This lists the names of the files and directories in the current directory,
except those whose names begin with a dot (.) character.

$ ls '*'

This lists the name of a file or directory called * (if there is one) in the
current directory.

$ echo junk

This prints the word "junk" (without quotes) to the screen.

$ echo /

This prints the character "/" (without quotes) to the screen.

$ echo

This prints a blank line to the screen.

$ echo *

The shell interprets the character * as a wildcard, matching in the current
directory all files and subdirectories (if any) whose names do not begin with a
dot (.) character.  The resulting list is passed to the echo command, which
prints the list of matched file and directory names to the screen.  If there
are no files or subdirectories that match the wildcard, then a literal '*'
character is passed to the echo command, which prints that character on the
screen.

$ echo '*'

The single quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the '*' character as a
wildcard.  Instead, the '*' character is passed on intact to the echo command,
which prints it to the screen.
