Speed improvements would most likely be gained by minimizing the number of
processes that needed to be spawned in the doctype script.

Removing the sort command would not impact the functionality of the script,
only add more work for awk to do.  For typical document lengths, the overhead
of spawing a process for sort would probably be greater than time needed for
awk to process multiple matches for troff macro commands like .PP.

Since replacing awk with other tools (*grep, sed, and shell logic) would
require multiple additional process invocations, keeping awk in the script is
desirable.  In fact, awk can perform all of the functions required for the
script, and this is probably the fastest solution.
