Per the authors' statement on page 290, the troff software with the ms macro
package was used to typeset the book.  Many of the macros listed in Table 9.1
were used to typeset paragraphs, displays, titles, footnotes, equations, and
tables, and to select fonts (roman, italic, bold, etc.) for a specific typeface
(Times Roman).  Font sizes could be changes to larger and smaller values with
the \s troff commands as listed in Table 9.3.  The Courier typeface was
selected using a custom .CW macro.

Lines of text beginning with macro names, like the ms sample on page 292, were
written in the troff source with a leading \& to prevent interpretation of the
macro name.  Lines like the following on page 299, with a leading literal
escape character (backslash):

\e&.TL

were entered into the troff source as:

\ee&.TL

Domain-specific input to the supplemental commands pic, tbl, and eqn were used
to specify the details of pictures (digital line drawings), tables, and
mathematical expressions, respectively.  These tools, in turn, generated input
for the troff command in the following Unix command pipeline:

cat docname | pic | tbl | eqn | troff -ms

Output from this pipeline was then postprocessed with another tool to create a
specification for a formatted document in a language that the Mergenthaler
Linotron 202 phototypesetter could process to create page proofs.
