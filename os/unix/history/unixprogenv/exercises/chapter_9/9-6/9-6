doctype is more flexible than a shell script written to process a specific
document, since doctype can be written once and reused without modification on
any troff documents.

However, doctype as written does not execute the generated troff pipeline; it
only prints the required commands, which must then be executed in a separate
step.  This limitation is easily remedied by modifying doctype to run the
commands, as in Exercise 9-4.
