On Debian Linux, the package bsdgames contains the quiz(6) program as well as
the text file /usr/share/games/bsdgames/quiz/ed which has the 53 quiz questions
and answers for the ed editor quiz.  The question and answer file is the same
as it was on Version 7 Unix.

To run quiz(6) on the ed quiz questions, use the following command:

$ /usr/games/quiz function ed-command

Some of the questions require a fairly complex ed command string for a correct
answer.

The following notes apply to the quiz data file format:

- Each question begins on a separate line, following by a colon and the
corresponding answer.

- The backslash \ is a line continuation character.

- Square brackets [] contain a list of acceptable alternative strings in an
  answer.  For example, [ab|cd|ef] means that any of the strings ab, cd, or ef
is acceptable at the position in the answer string where the bracketed list of
options appears; exactly one of the alternatives must be entered by the user
for the answer to be considered correct.

- Curly braces {} contain strings that are optional in an answer.
