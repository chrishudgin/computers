On Debian Linux, the package bsdgames contains the quiz(6) program as well as
the file /usr/share/games/bsdgames/quiz/ed which has the quiz questions and
answers for the ed editor quiz.

To run quiz(6) on the ed quiz questions, use the following command:

$ /usr/games/quiz function ed-command

The following notes apply to the quiz answers as they are written in the
quiz question and answer file for ed:

- Each question begins on a separate line, following by a colon and the
corresponding answer.

- The backslash \ is a line continuation character.

- Square brackets [] contain a list of acceptable alternative strings in an
  answer.  For example, [ab|cd|ef] means that any of the strings ab, cd, or ef
is acceptable at the position in the answer where the bracketed list of options
appears; exactly one of the alternatives must be entered by the user for the
answer to be considered correct.

- Curly braces {} contain strings that are optional in an answer.
