The pwd command can operate in two distinct ways depending on how it is
implemented.

As a built-in shell command, it can simply refer to the name of the current
working directory that the shell itself tracks.

As a separate command requiring its own process, the pwd command must
recursively backtrack from the current directory up to the root directory, one
directory at a time, in order to build up the complete path to the current
directory (in reverse).  At each step towards the root, the pwd command obtains
the inode number of the directory at the level it is querying (by looking up
the inode number for the "." directory), then looks at the directory one level
up to obtain the name of the directory that corresponds to the inode number
already obtained.
