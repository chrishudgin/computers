ls -l reports 4 links to recipes because it is a directory with 4 links
(entries) in it:

The file "cookie"
The file "pie"
The directory . (a link to the recipes directory itself)
The directory .. (a link to the parent directory of the recipes directory)

This information is useful for directories because it indicates how many files
and subdirectories are in it.  It is useful for files because it indicates how
many hard links there are to the file; if a file has more than one hard link,
removing one link will not remove the file from the filesystem or free its
storage.
