The ls command reads the list of filenames placed at regular intervals in a
directory file.  When options are specified to the ls command, like -l, which
require information about a file from an inode, the ls command first reads from
the directory file the name of the file and the inode number corresponding to a
filename, then gathers further information about the file from the inode with
that inode number.
