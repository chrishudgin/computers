du -a recurses directories to locate files and report their sizes, but du's
core function is to report file sizes, not other information about files.  It
does not (by itself) have the abiltity to execute an additional command line
for each file found, nor can it (by itself) limit the scope of files selected
recursively except by specifying the starting directory for recursion and the
filename pattern(s) to match.

find recurses directories to locate files as well, but it has the following
advantages over du for recursive file listings:

1. find can report more information about the files found using an ls-like
format without an additional Unix command having to be invoked.

2. find can spawn an arbitrary Unix command to perform an operation on those
files.

3. find can limit the scope of file search results by a wide number of
criteria, such as modification time, user ID, inode number, and more, not just
filename patterns.

On a Debian Linux system runing Linux kernel 6.1, "find . -name 'filename' -ls"
runs about twice as fast as a corresponding recursive du command piped to grep:
"du -a | grep 'filename'"

Building a new tool is appropriate when that tool needs to have significantly
more functionality (e.g. find) than another tool's side effect (du -a).  The
old tool with the side effect may still be faster or more convenient for the
special case in which the functions of both tools overlap.
