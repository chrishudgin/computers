/dev/mt0 does not peform an automatic rewind after every operation; /dev/rmt0
does rewind automatically after every use.

On systems with many disks or tapes, placing their device files into respective
subdirectories keeps the /dev directory itself from becoming too cluttered.  It
also makes it clearer to the user which device files correspond to disks,
tapes, etc.
