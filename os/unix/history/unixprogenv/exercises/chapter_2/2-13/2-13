To see how recently a currently logged in user has been active at their
terminal, use the "who" command to see whether they are logged in and which
terminal device they are using, then use the "ls -l" command check the
timestamp for their terminal device file.  The timestamp will indicate the last
time they wrote anything to their terminal, such as by running a command on it.
