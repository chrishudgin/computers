The write(1) command checks to see if the specified user is currently logged in
by reading the list of logged in users and their terminal devices from
/etc/utmp.  If the specified user is logged in, write(1) will attempt to write
to the user's login terminal; this should succeed as long as write permissions
for the writing user's group or for "other" users are enabled on the
destination login terminal.  These write permissions can be toggled on or off
for a user's terminal device using "mesg y" or "mesg n", respectively.
