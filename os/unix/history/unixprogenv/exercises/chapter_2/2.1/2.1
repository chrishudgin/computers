ctl-d is the terminal's line flush character, so if ctl-d is typed on a line by
itself when ed is expecting interactive command input at the terminal, its
input read will return EOF (end of file).  This tells ed that there is no more
command input to process in the current editing session--equivalent to sending
ed a "q" command to quit.

When ed reads its command input from a file, as in:

ed < file

the input read will return EOF (end of file) when the end of the file is
reached.

In both cases, ed treats an input read returning EOF as a request to quit.  If
ed is reading its commands from a file instead of interactively from a
terminal, it will quit unconditionally when a read returns EOF, even if the
work (data) file has been modified by ed commands without those modifications
being saved to the file.
