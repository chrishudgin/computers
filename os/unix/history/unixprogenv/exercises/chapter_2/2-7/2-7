$ mv junk junk1

simply changes the name of an existing hard link (filename associated with an
inode) from "junk" to "junk1".  It does not copy or move any file contents,
create a new file (even temporarily), or change the inode number for the file.

$ cp junk junk1
$ rm junk

first creates (via the cp command) an additional copy of the file "junk" called
"junk1".  The new file has its own storage space, inode, and inode number in
addition to its own name.  The storage space, inode, and inode number
associated with the file "junk" are reclaimed by the rm command.  The net
result is that there is a new file on the filesystem called "junk1" that has
the same content that the (no longer existing) file "junk" did.
