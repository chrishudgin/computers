Since Unix is a multi-user operating system, multiple users could be logged in
at once, each with their own terminal device.  Since the /dev directory is
shared by all users, /dev/tty cannot link to a single user's login terminal or
the /dev/tty device would not be available for use by other users.

In V7 Unix, the user's login terminal device has the following ownership and
permissions:

/dev/console  rw--w--w-   you:bin

while the /dev/tty device has the following:

/dev/tty      rw-rw-rw-   root:other

Changing the permissions of /dev/tty to rw--w--w- would mean removing group
read permission for the "other" group, which would probably have no discernable
effect, as well as removing read permission for users other than root.

Removing read permission for users other than root would mean that non-root
users would no longer be able to read from their terminal device using the
convenient device name /dev/tty; they would have to determine and then use the
name of their login terminal device instead.  This would break utilities such
as crypt which are written to take all or some of their input from /dev/tty.
