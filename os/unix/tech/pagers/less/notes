Entering "-i" while less is running will toggle between case-insensitive search
and case-sensitive search (the default with no options specified).

However, a search string must be in all lower case in order for
case-insensitivity to be effective with "-i".  Entering a string with any
capital letters will search only for that string with the same capitalization,
even if less is running in "case-insensitive" mode.

To force searches to be completely insensitive to case, use "-I" rather than
"-i".

The "man" command on Linux uses "less -ix8RmPm" (with or without -s) as its
default pager command, through the use of the $LESS environment variable and
additional command line options.

less can read compressed files automatically through the /usr/bin/lesspipe.sh
script set in the $LESSOPEN environment variable.
