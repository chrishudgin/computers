Some commands like "journalctl" and "nmcli con show <interface>" in Linux page
their output by default.  They may or may not have a built-in way to disable
paging of output (like the --no-pager option on the journalctl command line or
setting $SYSTEMD_PAGER to an empty string for systemctl).  However, all
well-behaved programs that page output by default should disable paging when
they detect that their output is being sent to a pipe rather than to a tty.
Thus, one general technique for disabling paging of output is to pipe the
command output through cat, e.g.:

# nmcli con show eth0 | cat
