Output sent to stdout is buffered and is not synchronous with writes until a
newline character is sent.  If a program that writes to stdout does not call
fflush(3), either explicitly or implicitly (e.g.  through exit(3)), any data
left unflushed in the buffer may be lost when the program exits.  This is true
even if the program's output is redirected through a pipe or to a file.

Output sent to stderr is not buffered and is synchronous with writes.
