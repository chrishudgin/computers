If the autofs implementation supports including configuration files from (e.g.)
/etc/auto.master.d, as through the following line in /etc/auto.master:

+dir:/etc/auto.master.d

then additional configuration files can be dropped in to the included directory
so that the file /etc/auto.master itself does not need to be modified.

Configuring an indirect map (one that provides a relative directory name as the
key to determine which NFS directory to mount from the server), as for example
automounting users' home directories using the username as the key and a base
dir like /home or /export/home, still requires creating two files if one of
them is a drop-in to /etc/auto.master.d.

Example:

# cat /etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs
/export/home	/etc/auto.home
# cat /etc/auto.home
*	-rw,intr,hard	server1:/export/home/&
