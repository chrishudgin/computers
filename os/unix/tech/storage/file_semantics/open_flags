The open() mode flags flags O_TRUNC (01000) and O_APPEND (02000) are not
mutually exclusive and can be combined.  When they are combined, they mean the
following:

When the file is opened, its existing contents (if any) will be destroyed.  Any
subsequent writes to the file will be appends, even if lseek is called to
change the offset between writes.  In other words, with O_APPEND, write will
always seek to the end of the file before writing.

In contrast:

When using O_TRUNC but not O_APPEND, the file's existing contents (if any) will
be destroyed, and each write will occur at the current offset within the file.

When using O_APPEND but not O_TRUNC, all writes will append to the file, and
the file's existing contents will not be destroyed.

The numeric values for O_TRUNC, O_APPEND, and other flags recognized by open()
are specified in octal and are located on Linux in
/usr/include/asm-generic/fcntl.h
