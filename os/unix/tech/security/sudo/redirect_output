Redirecting the output of a command run through sudo using the shell's output
redirection operators like > will not work if the operation of the redirection
requires sudo privileges, since the shell will attempt the operation before
sudo has run.

This will NOT work as an unprivileged user:
$ echo abc | sudo cat > /root/abcfile

Instead, run:
$ echo abc | sudo sh -c 'cat > /root/abcfile'
or
$ echo abc | sudo tee /root/abcfile > /dev/null
