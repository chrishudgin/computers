The syntax of the privileged access assignments in /etc/sudoers is:

user	MACHINE=COMMANDS

COMMANDS may include a Runas_Alias or Runas_Spec in parentheses specifying the
users and/or groups (group list preceded by a colon) as which the designated
user may run the commands.  A Runas_Spec of ALL means all users, but not all
groups.  To allow Runas as all users and all groups, you must specify ALL:ALL

Examples:

joeuser	CLUSTER1 = (clustadmin, clustoper : clustgroup) /usr/sbin/cluster_start

joeuser may run the command /usr/sbin/cluster_start as clustadmin or clustoper,
and/or as group clustgroup, on the machines in Host_Alias CLUSTER1.

joeuser ALL=(ALL) ALL

joeuser may run any command on any machine as any user, but may not specify
any group other the primary group of the user account specified.

joeuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

joeuser may run any command on any machine as any user and/or any group.
