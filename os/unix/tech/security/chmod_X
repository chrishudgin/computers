In the chmod command (and by extension the setfacl command), the 'X' (capital
X) mode means set execute permission on a directory, or set execute permission
on a file only if it already has some execute bit set on it (for user, group,
and/or other).

Example:
$ chmod o+X /some/dir  # unconditionally set execute permission for other on dir
$ chmod o+X somefile  # if user, group, and/or other execute perm is already
   set, set execute permission for other on somefile
