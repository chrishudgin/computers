The setgid bit on a directory has two effects:

1. All new files and subdirectories created in the directory will be owned by
the same group that owns the directory.

2. All new subdirectories created in the directory will inherit the setgid bit.

Existing files and subdirectories will not have their owning group changed, nor
will files or directories that are moved (with mv) into the directory from
another location.
