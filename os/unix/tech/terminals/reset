Initialize a terminal's settings using its terminfo entry:

$ tput init

Reset a terminal's settings using its terminfo entry:

$ tput reset

*****

The standalone "reset" command is a symlink to tset.  tset is provided by
termcap, which predates terminfo.

*****

Set generic terminal mode options and meanings of special characters to their
default settings:

$ stty sane

*****

In some cases, nothing short of bouncing the terminal listener process (getty)
or power-cycling a physical terminal will suffice to correct a malfunctioning
terminal connection.
