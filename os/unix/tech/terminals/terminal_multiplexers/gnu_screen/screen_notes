By default, screen will capture mouse input, preventing normal scrolling of the
terminal window in which screen is running.  To prevent screen from capturing
the mouse and thereby to enable normal window scrolling when screen is running,
add the following line to $HOME/.screenrc:

termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@

Reference:

The termcap command before the colon (ti@, disable [@] the commands used when
starting a program that uses cursor motion) applies to the terminal; the
termcap command after the colon (te@, disable [@] the commands used when ending
a program that uses cursor motion) applies to the windows created by screen.

The net effect is that the terminal (not the screen command) retains control of
cursor movement commands such as would be generated by a scroll wheel or mouse.

Detached screen sessions do not appear in the output of "who" or "w".
