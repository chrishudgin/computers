Ctrl-Spacebar or Ctrl-@ will send an ASCII NUL (0x0) character to the terminal.

Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q will block and resume terminal output, so that a process
attempting to write to a terminal will block and sleep.  The thread does not
stop (block) until it attempts to write to the terminal.  As soon as it does,
it sleeps until Ctrl-Q is pressed.  Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q do not send signals to
any process.

Ctrl-D flushes the terminal's input buffer, immediately sending all characters
that have been entered on the current input line to the program reading from
the terminal.  If the input buffer is empty, then sending Ctrl-D will cause the
reading program to read zero bytes and receive an EOF return code on the read.

Ctrl-C sends a SIGINT to the foreground process group.

Ctrl-Z sends a SIGTSTP to the foreground process group.

bg and fg send a SIGCONT to the specified job (process group).
fg also makes the specified job (process group) become the foreground process
group (on Linux via a TIOCSPGRP ioctl), and the shell calls wait().
