Measure network bandwidth between two points with iperf3:

Designate one end of the connection as the server and the other as the client.

On the server side:

$ iperf3 -s [-p <tcp_portnum>]

The server process will listen for connections on TCP port 5201 by default.

On the client side:

$ iperf3 -c <server_hostname_or_address>

With default settings, the connection bitrate will be reported by both
processes at one second intervals for ten intervals.  Both settings are
adjustable with command line parameters for the client side process.

Terminate the server side process when testing is complete.
