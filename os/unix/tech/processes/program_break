The program break is the first memory address above a process's data segment.
This will be the first address above the .bss section if the program has a .bss
section.  The memory at the break address is unmapped, and referencing it will
cause a segmentation fault.  Once the break has been moved to a higher address
with brk() or sbrk(), memory from the original break address up to (but not
including) the new break address is accessible to the program (read/write) and
will be mapped to physical memory as it is accessed.
