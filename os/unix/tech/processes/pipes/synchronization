Pipe synchronization between processes is done by the kernel as follows:

The writing process is paused when the pipe buffer becomes full.
The reading process is paused when the pipe buffer becomes empty.
The reading process receives EOF on read when the buffer is empty and the
   writing process's write file descriptor for the pipe is closed.
