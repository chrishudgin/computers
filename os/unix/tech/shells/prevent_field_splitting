After expansions and substitutions are made to an input command line, the shell
will perform field splitting.

From the Single UNIX Specification V3:

"If the value of IFS is a <space>, <tab>, and <newline>, or if it is unset, any
sequence of <space>, <tab>, or <newline> characters at the beginning or end of
the input shall be ignored and any sequence of those characters within the
input shall delimit a field."

This means that, for example, using "echo" to display the value of an unquoted
variable whose value includes leading or trailing whitespace will result in
such whitespace being removed by the shell before echo receives its input.
Moreover, newlines in the contents of the variable will be replaced by spaces.

To prevent field splitting of a variable's value and the consequent whitespace
removal and newline replacement, enclose the name of the variable in double
quotes:

$ echo "$FOO"
rather than
$ echo $FOO
