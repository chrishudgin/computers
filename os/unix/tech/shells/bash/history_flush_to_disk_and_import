To flush (append) all command history in memory to disk immediately instead of
waiting until shell exit:
$ history -a

To append the contents of the history file ~/.bash_history to the current
shell history in memory:
$ history -r

(Note: The related "history -n" does not seem to work reliably in RHEL 7.5.)

By using these two commands together in two different shells, the history
from one shell can be imported into the other shell without having to exit
either shell.
