The variables $_ and $! can both be used to expand to the final argument on a
command line, but they do not work identically.

$_ expands to the final argument seen by the previously invoked command.
   It therefore does not include I/O redirections such as "> /myfile" since
   they are processed by the shell and not sent to or seen by the command in
   its argument list.

!$ expands to the final word of the previously entered command line.
  It therefore will include an I/O redirection target (without the
  redirection symbol) if one appears at the end of the previous command line.

Examples:

$ ls /usr /home > outfile
$ echo $_
/home
$ ls /usr /home > outfile
$ echo !$
echo outfile
outfile

$ ls /usr /home >outfile
$ echo $_
/home
$ ls /usr /home >outfile
$ echo !$
echo outfile
outfile
