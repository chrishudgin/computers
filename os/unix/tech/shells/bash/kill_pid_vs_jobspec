If kill is used to send a signal other than SIGKILL to a stopped background
job by PID, the process will only receive the signal after it later wakes up
(e.g. by bringing the process into the foreground).

If kill is used to send a signal to a jobspec (e.g. "kill %1") for a stopped
background job, the job's processes will be awakened immediately so that the
signal can be delivered to them immediately as well.
