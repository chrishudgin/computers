bash outputs the prompt to its own standard error stream.

Just before printing the prompt on standard error, bash runs the command in
$PROMPT_COMMAND if set.  This is typically set to a printf of an escape
sequence followed by the prompt string, a BEL character, and additional strings
such as the username, short hostname, and current working directory.  The
output of the $PROMPT_COMMAND, which goes to standard output, can be processed
by a terminal application in order to display the prompt in, e.g. the terminal
title bar.
