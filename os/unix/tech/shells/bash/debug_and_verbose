The debug (-x) and verbose (-v) flags can be used together for debugging
purposes.

-x : Displays each shell command after expansion and substitution
     have been performed on the command line.  To each command string
     displayed is prepended one or more times by the value of the PS4 variable,
     which defaults to the '+' character.  The number of PS4 strings ('+' signs)
     preceding a printed command string indicates the shell nesting (subshell)
     level within a script (which may not correspond exactly to the value of
     $SHLVL).  A single '+' preceding a command indicates execution in the
     top level shell of the script or interactive command line.

-v : Displays each command before expansion and substitution have been performed
     on the command line.

Combining the -x and -v options results in displaying each command both before
and after expansion and substitution have been performed, which is useful for
checking that the resulting strings have the expected contents.

Example:

$ cat debug_test.sh
echo $SHLVL
ls $HOME
echo $(echo $(echo $(echo $SHLVL)))
$ bash -x ./debug_test.sh
+ echo 2
2
+ ls /home/myuser

+ echo 2

$ bash -v ./debug_test.sh

echo $(echo $(echo $(echo $SHLVL)))
