Shell globbing rules for expansion of pathnames are described in glob(7)

To invert a glob pattern (match all but the pattern):
$ shopt -s extglob
and then use !(pattern)

An inverted pattern will not match files beginning with dot (.)

Example to remove all files except those beginning with dot (.), c, or d:
$ shopt -s extglob
$ rm !([cd]*)

Example to remove all files except those beginning with c or d, including 
removing files beginning with a dot (.) :
$ shopt -s extglob
$ rm !([cd]*) .[!.]*

Example to remove all files except those beginning with c or d, including 
removing files beginning with a dot (.) unless they begin with .c or .d :
$ shopt -s extglob
$ rm !([cd]*) .[!.cd]*
