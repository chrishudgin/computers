If there are running foreground jobs when a shell is terminated, they will be
sent a SIGHUP when the shell exits.

If there are stopped background jobs when a shell exit is commanded, the shell
will print a warning message, "There are stopped jobs", and will not exit until
another shell exit is commanded.  When a subsequent shell exit is commanded,
the shell will kill all stopped jobs with SIGTERM and exit.

If the only background jobs are running, and checkjobs is set to on, the shell
will print a warning message, "There are running jobs", and will not exit until
another shell exit is commanded.  When a subsquent shell exit is commanded, or
if checkjobs was set to off (default), the shell will exit immediately without
prompting.  If huponexit is set to off (default), the shell will not send any
signal to running background jobs.  If huponexit is set to on, all running
background jobs will be sent SIGHUP when the shell actually exits.
