bash sources the following scripts when started:

Login shell:

/etc/profile
   (on RHEL, the default /etc/profile also calls /etc/profile.d/*.sh)
   Sets umask and environment variables including $PATH
~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile (but not both)
   (on RHEL, the default ~/.bash_profile also calls ~/.bashrc)

Non-login shell:

~/.bashrc
   (on RHEL, the default ~/.bashrc also calls /etc/bashrc, which sets PS1
    and umask)
   Sets functions and aliases 

Non-interactive shell:

File given by $BASH_ENV

/etc/environment is read by the pam_env.so module after it reads
   /etc/security/pam_env.conf.  It is not read by bash, but at login bash will
   inherit environment variables set in these files.  Neither file is a shell
   script.  /etc/environment can contain VAR=VALUE pairs, but not "export" or
   other shell commands.
