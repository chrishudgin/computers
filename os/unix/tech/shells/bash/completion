bash loads its list of completion capabilities at user login when /etc/profile
sources /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh, which sources
/usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion

Using complete's _longopt function, bash can run an arbitrary command with
the --help option and parse its output for all displayed long options.

A list of bash's current completion capabilities is available from the
"complete" builtin (but note that these can be dynamically extended by
running any additional command followed by -- , provided that the command
displays its long options when sent the option --help).

Example:
$ foo --<Tab><Tab>
--someopt
--anotheropt
--athirdopt
