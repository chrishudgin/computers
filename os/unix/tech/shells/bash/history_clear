To clear current shell's history from memory:
$ history -c

To overwrite the saved shell history in ~/.bash_history with the current
shell's history:
$ history -w

Together these commands can be used to clear the saved shell history.
(Alternatively, the ~/.bash_history file can be removed or truncated after
history -c)
