One way to prevent a script from running certain commands if the same script is
already running is to use the flock(1) command to attempt to set an advisory
lock on a file and exit if the lock cannot be taken (before the critical
commands later in the script can be run).

Example shell script fragment:

$ cat myscript
...
exec 4> .myscript.lockfile
flock -n 4
...
<some_critical_commands>
...
$

When the script exits, file descriptor 4 will be closed and the lock on the
file to which it points will be released.
