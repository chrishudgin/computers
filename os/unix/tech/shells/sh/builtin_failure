In the original Bourne Shell from 7th Edition UNIX, failure of a builtin
command like "cd" in a shell script would, by design, cause the script to
abort.  In modern shells like bash, a shell script will continue to execute
even after a builtin command has failed, unless the "-e" flag has been set for
the shell (as in "set -e") which causes the shell to exit on all command
failures (those that return a nonzero exit status).
