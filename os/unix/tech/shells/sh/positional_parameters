"$*" expands to "$1 $2 $3 ..." as a single string
"$@" expands to "$1" "$2" "$3" ... as multiple strings

The difference can be seen in the following shell scripts:

$ cat dollar_star
for arg in "$*"
do
        echo $arg
done
$ ./dollar_star a b c
a b c
$ cat dollar_at
for arg in "$@"
do
        echo $arg
done
$ ./dollar_at a b c
a
b
c
