The following table is taken from the paper "An Introduction to the UNIX Shell"
by S.R. Bourne:

                      metacharacter
	\	$	*	`	"	'
'	n	n	n	n	n	t
`	y	n	n	t	n	n
"	y	y	n	y	t	n

	t	terminator
	y	interpreted
	n	not interpreted

*****

Text within double quotes " " is not subject to globbing (including pathname
expansion), tilde expansion, or brace expansion, but is still subject to
variable substitution and command substitution.

Text within single quotes ' ' is not subject to globbing (including pathname
expansion), tilde expansion, brace expansion, variable substitution, or command
substitution.

*****

Text enclosed within quotes is treated as a single string, regardless of what
whitespace may be contained within it.  It is therefore good practice when
comparing strings to enclose in double quotes each side of the comparison.

Example:
[ "${MYSTRING}" = "foobar" ] && do some command

Note: As long as the shell variable "nounset" is set to the default value of
off, a variable expansion that yields an empty string is not an error.
