Syntax:

trap [[action] SIGNAL ...]

"action" may be a null list, "", which causes the signals specified to be be
ignored.

If "action" is omitted but one or more signals are given, the actions for the
signals in the list are reset to the default actions for those signals.

If "trap" is called with no arguments, it displays all non-default actions and
their associated signals.

An explicit "exit" command is required in "action" if process termination for a
handled signal is desired.

A pseudo-signal number of 0 indicates that the associated action is to be taken
upon shell exit.

Example:

$ cat trapscript
tmpfile=/tmp/foo.$$
trap "rm -f $tmpfile; exit" 1 2 3 15  # set an action for signals 1, 2, 3, 15
trap "" 1  # ignore signal 1
trap 2     # reset action for signal 2 to default
trap "echo exiting..." 0   # run an echo command when shell exits
trap
$ chmod 755 trapscript
$ ./trapscript
0: echo exiting...
1: 
3: rm -f /tmp/foo.1301; exit
15: rm -f /tmp/foo.1301; exit
exiting...
