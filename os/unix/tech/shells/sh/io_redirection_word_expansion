In the original Bourne Shell from 7th Edition UNIX, I/O redirection targets
are not subject to filename expansion.

Example:

$ ls
$ cat > a.c
1 2 3
<Ctrl-D>
$ cat > *.c
foo bar
<Ctrl-D>
$ ls
a.c
*.c

The redirection in "cat > *.c" did not append to the file called a.c but
instead created a new file '*.c'.

This behavior is retained in the Debian Almquist Shell, dash.

In the Bourne Again Shell, bash, this behavior is changed and filename
expansion is performed for shell I/O redirection targets.
