The predicate for a while loop can be a list of commands.  If there is more
than one command in the list, then the exit status of the last command in the
list is checked by the shell to determine whether the while loop should
continue (exit status 0) or not (exit status nonzero).

Example, taken from the paper "An Introduction to the UNIX Shell" by S.R.
Bourne:

while echo "$i:"; trap exit 2; read x
do
	trap : 2
	eval $x
done
...

If a signal 2 (SIGINT) is received while waiting for input in "read x", the
script exits.

If "read x" returns EOF (as it would if Ctrl-D is entered at the prompt), then
the while loop terminates and the rest of the script is executed.
