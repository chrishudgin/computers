Avoid having to include a pipe to "grep -v grep" when filtering for a
process string from ps:

$ ps -ef | grep '[f]oo'

This works because the arg string of the grep process itself will be of the form
   grep [f]oo
which does not match the regular expression for which grep will filter, [f]oo
(meaning f followed by oo).  Thus grep will not return itself in its list of
matched lines.
