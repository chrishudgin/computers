cp -a : preserve all attributes (including symlinks) and copy recursively

To recursively copy all files and directories within a directory to another
directory while preserving all permissions and attributes,  use:
cp -a /sourcedir/. /targetdir
The trailing /. in the source specification ensures that a subdirectory
named "sourcedir" is not created in /targetdir, only copies of its contents.
