Generate a PDF of a man page, for example from 7th Edition UNIX:

Transfer the man page file to a target system that has groff installed.  If
this cannot be done directly through such means as scp or ftp, use copy and
paste between terminal windows to copy the text of the man page source file
from /usr/[share/]man/man[1-8]/<manpage>.[1-8] on the host system to the target
system.

On the target system with groff:
$ man -Tpdf ./<manpage>.[1-8] > <manpage>_V7.[1-8].pdf

Example:

$ man -Tpdf ./dd.1 > dd_V7.1.pdf
