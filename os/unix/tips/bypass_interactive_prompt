Some commands like "fdisk <device>" in Linux and "format" in Solaris prompt for
user input when their input source is a tty.

Bypass all interactive prompts even if the program is running on a tty by
sending null input to the command through a pipe from echo:

# echo | format

Send a non-interactive response to the command's first input prompt using echo:

# echo p | fdisk /dev/sda

Send a batch of non-interactive responses to a command's input prompts using a
here document:

# fdisk /dev/sda << FOO
d
6
w
FOO
