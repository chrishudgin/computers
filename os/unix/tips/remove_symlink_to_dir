Shell autocompletion will append a trailing slash to a symlink that points to a
directory.  This causes commands like rm to interpret the argument as a
directory rather than as a symlink, which can lead to unexpected results.  To
ensure that the symlink name is interpreted as a symlink rather than as a
directory name, remove the trailing slash before passing its name as an
argument.
