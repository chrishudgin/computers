Within test brackets [ ], enclose a variable within double quotes to ensure
that a syntax error does not result if the variable is empty.

Example:

Use:

[ "${menuchoice}" = 3 ]  # if $menuchoice is not set, empty string "" can
                           still be evaluated and compared to 3 without a
                           syntax error

rather than:

[ ${menuchoice} = 3 ]   # syntax error if $menuchoice is not set to a value
