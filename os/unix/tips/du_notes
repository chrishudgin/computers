Size units:

du can show allocated disk space for files in kibibytes (the default),
human-friendly units (-h), or arbitrary block size (--block-size=XXX)
consisting of an integer number of bytes or an integer multiple of a symbolic
power of 1024 (K, M, G, etc.)--e.g. 10M, 1024K, etc.

The minimum size shown is 0 for empty files, 1 for any file of nonzero size.
