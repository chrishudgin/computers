Recursion with ls -R does not imply -a; to show hidden files, too, use -aR.

*****

Show actual file disk space usage, in default unit of blocks (equivalent to
du):
$ ls -s

Useful for showing sizes of sparse files like virtual machine disk images

Caution: -l, if specified, overrides -s regardless of the order of options on
the ls command line.

*****

Size units:

ls can show file sizes in bytes (default for -l), physically allocated blocks
on disk (default for -s), kibibytes (-k), human-friendly units (-h), or
arbitrary block size (--block-size=XXX) consisting of an integer number of
bytes or an integer multiple of a symbolic power of 1024 (K, M, G, etc.)--e.g.
10M, 1024K, etc.

The minimum size shown is 0 for empty files, 1 for any file of nonzero size.

*****

Displaying the full date, including the year, for all files:

By default, ls with the "long" option (-l) shows the hour and minute instead of
the year in the timestamp of a file if the timestamp is more than 6 months in
the past (GNU ls and Solaris ls), or more than 6 months in the past or future
(BSD ls).  To ensure that the year portion of the timestamp is always shown,
use the following options:

GNU ls:
$ ls --full-time
or
$ ls -l --time-style "<date_specifier>"
   where <date_specifier> can be one of several ISO or locale-specific options
   or a format specifier in the syntax used by the "date" command, e.g. "+%Y"

BSD ls:
$ ls -l -T
or
$ ls -l -D "<date_specifier>"
   where <date_specifier> is in the format used by strftime(3), i.e. the format
   used by the "date" command but without a leading "+" sign.

Note: The -D option is not available in macOS.

Solaris ls:
$ ls -e
or
$ ls -E
  The -E option includes the nanosecond precision timestamp and UTC hour offset
