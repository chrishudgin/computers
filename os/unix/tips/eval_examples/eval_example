# eval can be used to construct variable names that are not generated until
# run time

read -p "Enter a variable name: " myvar
eval "${myvar}=FOO"   # sets variable name read from input equal to value FOO
eval echo "${myvar}=\$${myvar}"

cmd1="echo hello"
cmd2="echo goodbye"

read -p "Enter a number, 1 or 2: " num
echo

# Our intent here is to run either $cmd1 or $cmd2 depending on whether the
# user inputs "1" or "2"

# Without eval--does not work, as shell interprets this subsitution as
# the value of $cmd (which is empty) followed by the value of $num
# (which is 1 or 2), and tries to run "1" or "2" as a command
# $cmd${num}
# 
$cmd${num}  # Generates an error message since there are no commands "1" or "2"

# With eval--run $cmd1 or $cmd2
#
# The trick is to delay substitution of $cmd... until $num has been evaluated,
# then allow eval to evaluate $cmd1 or $cmd2 and run the resulting string
# as a command with arguments
#
# The shell processes the input as follows, assuming num=2:
# eval \$cmd$num
# eval $cmd2
# eval "echo goodbye"
# echo goodbye
# Output is:  goodbye
#
eval \$cmd$num
