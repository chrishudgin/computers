Three different AWK packages are available in the Debian 11 software
repositories:

mawk
gawk
original-awk

mawk is the AWK variant installed by default, available as /usr/bin/mawk,
/usr/bin/awk, and /usr/bin/nawk.

If original-awk is installed, it is available as /usr/bin/original-awk.  If
original-awk is configured as /usr/bin/awk by using
/usr/bin/update-alternatives, then the symlink /usr/bin/nawk is removed.

If gawk is installed, it is available as /usr/bin/gawk and also replaces mawk
as the active /usr/bin/awk and /usr/bin/nawk unless subsequently reconfigured
with /usr/bin/update-alternatives.

To configure a different awk for use as /usr/bin/awk, run:

# update-alternatives --config awk
There are 3 choices for the alternative awk (providing /usr/bin/awk).
