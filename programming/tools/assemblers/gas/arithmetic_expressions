When a symbol (which has an address) is used in an arithmetic expression
evaluated by the assembler, as in:

movl $RECORD_FIRSTNAME + record_buffer, %ecx

where record_buffer is a symbol and $RECORD_FIRSTNAME is a constant,

the symbol must NOT have a leading $ sign.

However, in contexts like the following, which do not use the symbol in an
arithmetic expression evaluated by the assembler:

pushl $record_buffer

the leading $ is required for the value to be interpreted as an address rather
than as the data at that address.
