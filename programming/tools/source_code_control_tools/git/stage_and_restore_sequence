The sequence through which files are staged, committed, or restored in Git is:

1. Working directory tree managed by Git.

<- git restore <file>
git add <file> ->

2. The Git index for the directory tree, contained in a subdirectory
   "index" under the ".git" directory for the tree.  The index normally
   contains one version of each file in the Git tree, but multiple versions of
   a file may be present during an uncommitted merge if there are conflicting
   contents in that file in the different versions that prevent a merge from
   completing.

<- git restore --staged <file>
git commit ->

3. The committed files under the ".git/objects" directory for the tree.
   These are stored in a zlib compressed format and contain a Git header
   specific to each file and the file's content appended to the header.
   Directory and file names are generated by a hash function in Git.
