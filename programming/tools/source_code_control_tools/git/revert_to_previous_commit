Undo the most recent commit, including reverting the contents of the working
directory:

$ git reset --hard HEAD~

Revert to a previous commit and create a new commit for the reversion:

General procedure:

# Reset index, working tree, and HEAD to specified commit
$ git reset --hard <commit>
# Reset HEAD to its value before the prior reset command was run and stage
# changes
$ git reset --soft "HEAD@{1}"
# Commit working tree 
$ git commit -m "Revert to <commit>"

Revert to a previous commit with a single new commit if there are no
intervening merge commits:

$ git revert --no-commit <commit>..HEAD
$ git commit -m "<Commit message>"
