git cherry-pick <commit> applies the specified commit to the current HEAD.  It
is useful when a specific single change, rather than a commit history, needs to
be applied.  For example, the chosen commit could contain a bug fix from a
development/testing branch that has other commits before and after the chosen
commit, but only the chosen commit with the bug fix needs to be applied to
production.  Another possible use case is applying a commit from an abandoned
but still extant feature branch.
