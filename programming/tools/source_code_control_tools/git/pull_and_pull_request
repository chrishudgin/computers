A Git pull is a "fetch and merge" of a branch.
Example:
$ git pull origin master  # fetch and merge the master branch
$ git pull origin development  # fetch and merge the development branch

A "pull request", in contrast, is a request for someone with push privileges on
a repo to merge your commits into the repo.  In other words, you are asking
them to pull your changes into the repo.
