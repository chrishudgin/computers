A Git pull is a "fetch and merge" of a branch.
Example:
$ git pull origin master
  (fetch the latest version of the master branch from the remote and merge its
   new commits with those of the current local branch)

An alternative to using git pull to perform a fetch and merge is using git
pull to perform a fetch and rebase:
$ git pull --rebase origin master
which will rebase commits from the local master branch onto the latest commit
fetched into the local repo from the remote master branch

A "pull request", in contrast, is a request for someone with push privileges on
a repo to merge your commits into the repo.  In other words, you are asking
them to pull your changes into the repo.
