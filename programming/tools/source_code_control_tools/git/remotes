Show remotes:

$ git remote [-v]
   -v shows URLs

If a user's clone of a repo is older than the most recent push to a remote by
another user, the user with the now out-of-date clone must fetch and merge the
updates from the remote to their local repo before they will be permitted to
push their own updates to the remote.
