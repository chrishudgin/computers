Clone a repo to create a local repo from remote:

$ git clone <remote_location> [-o <local_name_for_remote>]
  The default local name of the remote if not specified is "origin"
  The default branch is the one currently active on the remote
Example:
$ git clone git@gitserver:/git/myproject.git
$ git branch
* master

Switch to any branch that was present in the remote at the time it was cloned:
$ git branch -a
(Shows all branches available)
$ git checkout <branch>
  This creates a local branch that tracks the remote branch of the same name
Example:
$ git checkout development

Show summary information for remotes:

$ git remote [-v]
   -v shows URLs
Example:
$ git remote -v

Show detailed information for a remote:

$ git remote show <remote_name>
Example:
$ git remote show origin

If a user's clone of a repo is older than the most recent push to a remote by
another user, the user with the now out-of-date clone must fetch and merge the
updates from the remote to their local repo before they will be permitted to
push their own updates to the remote.

Update a local repo branch to match a branch on remote:
$ git pull <remote> <branch>
Example:
$ git pull origin master
