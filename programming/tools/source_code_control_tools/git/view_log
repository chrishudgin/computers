Note: git log commands will not show commits beyond (more recent than) the
current HEAD; such commits may exist if HEAD was moved backward, as with a "git
reset".

View log summary:

$ git log [--all] [<commit_range>]
  --all: show all branches
  <commit_range> defaults to HEAD; use "git reflog" to show commit IDs for
     previous HEAD locations and then supply the desired commit ID to "git log"
     to examine its log, or simply use "--reflog" instead of explicit commit
     IDs to show log entries for all commits listed in the reflog (including
     any that may be beyond the current HEAD)

View log with patch diffs:

$ git log -p

View log with summarized line add/delete statistics:

$ git log --stat

View log with only abbreviated commit ID and commit message on each line,
