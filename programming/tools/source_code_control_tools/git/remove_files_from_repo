Example of removing Git tracking of a file and staging its deletion in the
index:

$ git rm [-f] foodir/barfile  (this removes the file in the filesystem as well
   as updates git information)
   -f : forces the operation even if there are staged changes for the file
OR
$ git rm --cached foodir/barfile  (this removes the file from the list of
   tracked files, but not from the local filesystem directory)
$ git commit -a -m "commit"
$ git push -u origin master
