Example of remove a file to a git repository:

$ git rm foodir/barfile  (this removes the file in the filesystem as well as
   updates git information)
OR
$ git rm --cached foodir/barfile  (this removes the file from the index of
   tracked files, but not from the local filesystem directory)
$ git commit -a -m "commit"
$ git push -u origin master
