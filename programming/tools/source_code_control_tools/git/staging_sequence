The sequence through which files are staged and saved in Git is:

1. Directory tree managed by Git (i.e. the individual files).

git add ->

2. The Git index for the directory tree, contained in a subdirectory
   "index" under the ".git" directory for the tree.

git commit ->

3. The committed files under the ".git/objects" directory for the tree.
   These are stored in a zlib compressed format and contain a Git header
   specific to each file and the file's content appended to the header.
   Directory and file names are generated by a hash function in Git.
