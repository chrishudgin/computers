The command:

$ git stash [push]

stores the current state of tracked files (up to the latest "git add" that has
been run on them) in the working directory and index without performing a
commit.  This action is useful if you need to switch to a different branch and
work on it without losing incomplete and uncommitted work.  The index and
working directory are restored from the current branch's HEAD.

List changes in a stash:

$ git stash list

Show changes in a stash:

$ git stash show

Restore a stash and remove it from stash storage:

$ git stash pop
