List all commits:

$ git rev-list --all

The output of the command above can be used in other git commands that can take
multiple commits as arguments.  For example:

$ git grep -i printf $(git rev-list --all)
   # Shows printf occurrences in all managed files in current directory and
   # below in all commits.
