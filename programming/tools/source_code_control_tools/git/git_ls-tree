The "git ls-tree <tree object SHA-1 signature>" command shows tree (Git managed
directory) contents only relative to the current working directory unless the
--full-tree option is given.  The --full-tree will cause git ls-tree to show
files relative to the top level directory of the tree object specified (not
necessarily the top level directory of the entire managed Git tree).

The -r (recursive) option can also be supplied to show recursive directory
contents for a tree object.
