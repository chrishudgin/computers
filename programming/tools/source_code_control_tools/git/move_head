To move HEAD to a particular commit, for example after doing a "git reset
HEAD~" and then deciding you want to move HEAD back to its previous position,
first use "git reflog" to show the list of all operations that moved HEAD.
Then select the previous HEAD position you want, for instance by examining the
commit messages in the reflog, and do another "git reset" using HEAD position
you chose.

Example:

Suppose you've moved HEAD back one position on the current branch:
$ git reset --hard HEAD~
To return HEAD to its previous position:
$ git reflog
... (HEAD -> main): HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~
... HEAD@{1}: commit: Bug fix in foo2
...
...

$ git reset --hard "HEAD@{1}"
Now the commit with "Bug fix in foo2" is the HEAD again.
