git fetch updates objects in the local repo from a remote repo but does not
update the working directory or the index in the local repo or perform a merge.

git fetch creates a ref called FETCH_HEAD which includes the changes that would
be applied to HEAD in a subsequent merge of the fetched files ("git merge
FETCH_HEAD").

The inverse action is a git push, which updates objects in another repo from
the local repo but does not update the remote repo's working directory or index
or perform a merge there.
