Example of adding a directory and a file to a git repository and pushing it to
a remote:

$ git add databases/papers/somedir/  # note trailing slash
   # This adds all existing files and directories in and under somedir,
   # recursively, to the tracking list.  It will not automatically track new
   # files created later.
$ git add databases/papers/codd_paper_notes.docx 
$ git commit -v -a -m "commit"
$ git push -u origin master

Files and directories that are listed in a .gitignore file are ignored by the
"git add" command.

Paths in a .gitignore file that are specified with an absolute path (that is,
with a leading slash, /) are treated as relative to the root of the git managed tree.  Relative paths apply to any matching path found in the tree.

Examples from a hypothetical .gitignore file:

/security/foo  # applies only to a file called "foo" in the first level
               # subdirectory called "security" under the managed tree.

security/foo   # applies to any path ending in "security/foo", such as
               # security/foo, stuff/security/foo, more/stuff/security/foo, etc.
