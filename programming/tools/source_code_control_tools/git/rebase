Rebasing means altering diffs and commits to attach a branch derived from
another onto the tip of its ancestor branch, even if the ancestor branch has
had further commits since the two branches diverged.  This simplifies later
merging of the derived branch into the ancestor branch because a fast-forward
can be used (a linear advance of HEAD) instead of a three-way merge between two
branch tips and the most recent common ancestor commit.

The disadvantage of rebasing is that it alters existing commit history on which
other project contributors may have based their own branches.

A recommended use of rebasing is to rebase one's private branch onto the latest
commit in a public branch before pushing updates to the public branch.  Then
the private branch can be merged more easily into the public branch, as the
commit history along the public branch has been made linear (each commit having
only a single parent commit).
