Show differences between files in the tree and the Git index for that tree:
$ git diff

Show differences between files in the index and the last committed versions of
those files:

$ git diff --cached

Show differences in a given file between the second most recent commit (n-1)
and the most recent one (n):

$ git diff HEAD^ [HEAD] hello.c   # HEAD is assumed if not specified

Show a file as it appeared in a given commit:

$ git show HEAD^:./hello.c  # show hello.c in previous (parent, n-1) commit

In each case, the default output format for "git diff" is that of "diff -u",
the unified diff format that includes 3 lines of context around deletions and
additions.  A change to a line is recorded as a deletion followed immediately
by an addition.
