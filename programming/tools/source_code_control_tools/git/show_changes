Summarize changes to be committed and changes in the working directory that
are not staged:

$ git status

Show differences between files in the tree and the Git index for that tree,
i.e. what will happen to the files in the index when the files in the tree are
staged:

$ git diff [-- <file>]

Show differences between files in the index and the last committed versions of
those files, i.e. what will happen to the files in the database when files in
the index are committed:

$ git diff --cached [-- <file>]
OR
$ git diff --staged [-- <file>]

Show differences in a given file between the second most recent commit (n-1)
and the most recent one (n):

$ git diff HEAD^ [HEAD] hello.c   # HEAD is assumed if not specified

Show a file as it appeared in a given commit:

$ git show HEAD^:./hello.c  # show hello.c in previous (parent, n-1) commit

In each case, the default output format for "git diff" is that of "diff -u",
the unified diff format that includes 3 lines of context around deletions and
additions.  A change to a line is recorded as a deletion followed immediately
by an addition.
