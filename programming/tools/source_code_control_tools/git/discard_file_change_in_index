Discarding from the index an uncommitted change to a file:

($ echo "abc" > <file>; git add <file>; git commit -m "stuff";
   echo "def" > <file>; git add <file>; echo "ghi" > <file>)
$ git reset <file> (or git restore --staged <file>)

The "def" version of <file> that had been staged is no longer staged; it is
gone.  This will not affect the contents of the file in the repo or in the
working directory, whether the file has been modified since being staged or
not.  The file <file> in the working directory still has "ghi" in it, and this
version of the file has not been staged.
