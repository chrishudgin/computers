Show the native architecture and CPU settings for the platform:

$ gcc -mcpu=native -march=native -Q --help=target

For example, for maximum portability gcc defaults to -march=armv6+fp and no
setting for -mcpu on Raspberry Pi OS, but the native settings for these
variables on the Raspberry Pi Zero are armv6zk+fp and arm1176jzf-s,
respectively, as would be shown in the output of the command above.
