If a matching rule is not found in the Makefile, an implicit rule will be used
if one matches.  If neither a specified rule nor an implicit rule is found,
then if no target is specified on the command line, the first rule that does
not begin with a dot (.) is used; otherwise, if a target is specified on the
command line but no matching rule is found, the .DEFAULT rule (if any)
specified in the Makefile is used.

Examples of some of the implicit default rules:

CC=cc
CFLAGS=
.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

If a rule matches and the target does not yet exist, then the rule is run to
create the target.  If the target exists, its last modification time is
compared to those of its dependencies; if any dependencies were modified more
recently than the target, then the rule is run to update (recreate) the target.
