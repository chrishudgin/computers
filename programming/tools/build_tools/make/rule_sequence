If a rule is not found in the Makefile, an implicit rule will be used if one
matches.  If neither a specified rule nor an implicit rule is found, the
.DEFAULT rule (if any) specified in the Makefile will be used.

Examples of some of the implicit default rules:

CC=cc
CFLAGS=
.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
