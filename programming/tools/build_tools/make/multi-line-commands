A multi-line command in a makefile must be terminated with a line continuation
character in order for make to run it as a single command.

Futhermore, each line in a multi-line embedded shell script must be terminated
by a semicolon followed by the line continuation character.  This is because
make executes the embedded multi-line shell script on a single command line
with the newlines that separated commands removed; semicolons must therefore be
used instead to separate individual shell commands within the embedded script.
