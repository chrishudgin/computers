By default, gdb disables Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) before
running a target program.  ASLR can be toggled on or off and displayed as
follows:

gdb> set disable-randomization off  # enables ASLR
gdb> set disable-randomization on   # disables ASLR (default)

gdb> show disable-randomization
