Executing a program backwards requires the "record" feature to be turned on.
This must be done after the program begins execution, as in this example:

(gdb) b *main
(gdb) run
(gdb) record

Once recording is started and the program has executed at least one subsequent
instruction, reverse execution flow, including reverse stepping, is possible:

(gdb) reverse-continue or rc
(gdb) reverse-finish
(gdb) reverse-step or rs
(gdb) reverse-stepi or rsi
(gdb) reverse-next or rn
(gdb) reverse-nexti or rni

Stop recording and erase all recorded state:
(gdb) record stop
