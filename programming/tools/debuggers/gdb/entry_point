Display executable entry point address with:

i fi   (i.e. info file)

This will be the address of _start (most platforms) or __start (MIPS)

***

On some platforms (such as x86 and ARM), you can set a breakpoint using

b _start

or

b *_start

while on others (such as MIPS), you must include the asterisk:

b *__start

When setting a breakpoint using a function name, "b func" and "b *func" have
slightly different meanings:
b func: set a breakpoint at the first source line in the function, after
   function initialization / stack setup
b *func: set a breakpoint at the first assembly instruction in the function,
   at the beginning of function initialization / stack setup
