By default, GDB paginates the output of commands that display more than one
screenful of lines.

Pagination can be disabled:

(gdb) set pagination off

The built-in pager in GDB cannot scroll upward.

Starting with gdb 9.1, the output of a gdb command can be piped to a shall
command such as a more featureful pager like "less", as in these examples:

(gdb) pipe info registers | less
(gdb) pipe disassemble /s | less

If color output is being generated by a gdb command piped to "less", adding the
-R option to the "less" command will send the color escape codes from the gdb
output in "raw" form to the pager so that it can interpret and display them
correctly:

(gdb) pipe disassemble /s | less -R
