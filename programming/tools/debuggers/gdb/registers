For some gdb commands (like display), register names must be prefixed by a
dollar sign ($), as in "$edx".  For others, in which the operand is assumed
to be a register (as in the "info registers" command), the $ prefix is optional.

gdb provides four standard "pseudo-registers" called $pc, $sp, $fp, and $ps
whose values may not correspond to the actual values in the program counter,
stack pointer, frame pointer, and status register of a given platform.  They
are convenience "registers" that behave the same on all platforms, hiding
platform differences such as how sp and fp behave upon function entry/exit
and whether a read from the actual program counter register will yield the
current instruction or some pending instruction in a pipelined architecture.
