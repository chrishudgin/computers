x/rfs <address>

where:
r is repeat count
f is format:
Format letters are o(octal), x(hex), d(decimal), u(unsigned decimal),
  t(binary), f(float), a(address), i(instruction), c(char), s(string)
  and z(hex, zero padded on the left).
s is size abbreviation: b(byte), h(alfword), w(ord), g(iant) or doubleword
   On IA-32, x86-64, ARM32, and ARM64, GDB uses the following sizes
   b: 8 bits
   h: 16 bits
   w: 32 bits
   g: 64 bits

GDB interprets examined data according to the native byte order for the machine
(e.g. little endian for x86, big endian for earlier generations of PowerPC).
