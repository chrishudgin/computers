Running the "set architecture" command with no arguments from within gdb will
show the list of architectures that the running instance of gdb recognizes.  It
does not indicate which of the listed architectures are compatible with the
host hardware.

Example for gdb 10.1 on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B host with an ARMv7 CPU running
Raspberry Pi OS 11:

(gdb) set architecture
Requires an argument. Valid arguments are arm, armv2, armv2a, armv3, armv3m, armv4, armv4t, armv5, armv5t, armv5te, xscale, ep9312, iwmmxt, iwmmxt2, armv5tej, armv6, armv6kz, armv6t2, armv6k, armv7, armv6-m, armv6s-m, armv7e-m, armv8-a, armv8-r, armv8-m.base, armv8-m.main, armv8.1-m.main, arm_any, auto.
(gdb) set architecture armv7
The target architecture is set to "armv7".
