To force the display of an integer as a 32-bit value, cast it to the
   appropriate type:
p/d (int) $r1     # print value in register r1 as signed decimal int
p/u (int) $r1     # print value in register r1 as unsigned decimal int

To force the display of a char (least significant byte) as a signed value:
p/d (signed char) $r1    # print value in register r1 as signed char
