Section 6.1.3.1:

The second line of the "fractional constant" definition should read:

   digit-sequence .

The decimal point following "digit-sequence" is not printed in the ANSI
standard document or in Herbert Schildt's book _The Annotated ANSI C Standard_.

This error in the standard is corrected in C17 (section 6.4.4.2, "fractional
constant") and possibly in other versions of the standard after C90.

See http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/schildt.html#6-1-3-1

Schildt's book omits page 132 of the ANSI/ISO C Standard, instead printing
page 131 of the standard twice.
