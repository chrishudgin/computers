According to the ANSI C standard, an attempt to modify the contents of a const
variable results in undefined behavior.  Compilers may, but are not required
to, place the contents of const variables in read-only storage.  They are not
required to flag or prevent any attempts to modify a const variable directly or
indirectly.
