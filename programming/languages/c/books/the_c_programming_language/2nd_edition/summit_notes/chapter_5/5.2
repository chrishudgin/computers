To ensure that the loop on page 96 writes only valid numbers to the cells of
array, the loop can be modified to read:

for (n = 0; n < SIZE && getint(&array[n]) > 0; n++)
    ;

The reason getint must return two values instead of a single value as getchar
goes is because getint can potentially return any integer as valid input; there
are no "special" integer values (like negative values or zero) that can only
mean invalid input as there are with characters.  In order to distinguish
between valid integer input (which could include values like 0 and -1) and
non-integer input, separate return values are required for status (denoting
valid integer or non-integer) and the value of an integer from the input.  This
is explained in the book on page 96.
