If getop had been written to call atof itself instead of having main call atof,
then getop would also need to have been modified to return the floating point
value thus obtained.  This would have made it more difficult for getop to
return a command character as well, since pointers for function arguments have
not yet been introduced at this point in the book.  A one-element array as a
function argument would have worked but would have been an awkward solution.

The versions of getch and ungetch on page 79 of the book implement a last-in,
first-out stack.  Such a stack implementation is well-suited for handling
multiple characters of pushback.  It is easier to push back characters from
most recently read to least recently read (thus "backing up" along the input
stream a character at a time), and it is likely that the original input
ordering of the characters will be desired when they are re-read from the
ungetch stack for processing.  A stack naturally accommodates both of these
likely use cases.
