Note well the following statement:

"Since the compiler only compiles one source file at a time, it is never able
to detect inconsistencies between files (such as a function or variable
declared one way in once source file and some other way in another)."

This statement is true even if function prototypes are used, and even if the
compiler is given multiple source files to process in a single invocation.

The "splint" linter can detect when a function prototype declaration in one
file does not match the corresponding function definition in another file, but
only when the prototype is external.
