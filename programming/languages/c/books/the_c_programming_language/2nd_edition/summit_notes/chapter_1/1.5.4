This statement is syntactically valid and can therefore be evaluated:

if (c == (' ' || '\n' || '\t'))

C would evaluate the statement by checking, in order from left to right,
whether the clauses separated by || operators are "true" (nonzero) or "false"
(0).  Since the first character evaluated, ' ', has a nonzero value (for
example in the ASCII table), the resulting compound || statement always
evaluates to true (nonzero).  The "if" condition therefore evaluates to "true"
as well.
