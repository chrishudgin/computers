"In the clause 'the variable must also be declared in each function', the word
'declared' is an adjective, not a verb."

This statement concisely explains why an explicit external variable declaration
(e.g. "extern int i") is not required inside a function when the variable has
already been declared elsewhere, external to any function, and is in
scope--when the function is compiled, the variable is already in a state of
having been declared.
