"(Actually, some compilers or other program checkers do know that a function
named printf is special, and will do some extra checking for you, but you can't
count on it.)"

GCC is one such compiler that does do this extra checking and will warn if
format specifiers do not match argument types.  The original version of lint in
7th Edition UNIX did not check for consistency between printf's format strings
and arguments, but the more modern "splint" (Secure Programming Lint) utility
does.
