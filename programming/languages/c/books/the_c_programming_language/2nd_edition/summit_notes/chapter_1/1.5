Abstracting the text input/output model to a uniform standard is an important
way that C facilitates program portability across widely diverse computing
platforms.

The fact that getchar() is written in two places in version 1 of the copy
program does not mean that it is executed more often in the running program
than it would be in version 2 with a single getchar() in the source listing.
The disadvantages of writing it twice in the source are simply that doing so
makes the program source longer and more complicated for the programmer to
maintain.
