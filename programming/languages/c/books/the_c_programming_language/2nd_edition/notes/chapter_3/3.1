"In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it
is in languages like Pascal."

Gramatically, a separator must be used between consecutive statements but is
not required after a statement if the next construct in the program is not a
statement.  Examples of non-statements in Pascal are the keywords "else" and
"end".

In contrast, in C an explicit statement terminator is required after every
simple statement (but not after a compound statement), no matter what follows
the simple statement (such the "else" keyword or a closing brace).
