"In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it
is in languages like Pascal."

Gramatically in Pascal, a separator must be used between consecutive statements
but is not required after a statement if the next construct in the program is
not a statement.  Examples of non-statements in Pascal are the keywords "else"
and "end".

In contrast, in C an explicit statement terminator is required after every
simple statement (but not after a compound statement in braces), no matter what
follows the simple statement (such the "else" keyword or a closing brace).
