"... personal computers have capabilities that rival the mainframes of a decade
ago."

Among the characteristics of mainframes such as the IBM System/370 in 1978 were
32-bit general purpose registers, 64-bit floating point processing with
dedicated instructions, around 5 MIPS of processing performance, up to 16 MB of
RAM, and memory management hardware that provided virtual memory and memory
protection capabilities.  By 1988, all of these features were standard in
80386-based PCs.
