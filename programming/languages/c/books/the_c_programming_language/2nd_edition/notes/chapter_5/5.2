Due to the way getint is designed, the "for" loop on this page will skip an
array location (n will be incremented) each time getint is called and does NOT
find an integer or EOF on its scan.  Moreoever, getint will get "stuck", unable
to advance through the input any further, as soon as it reaches a non-integer
token, since it pushes back any such input with ungetch.  As soon as this
happens, the "for" loop will continue until it reaches the end of the array
without placing any more integers into the array.  Therefore, to work properly
with input that may contain non-integer data, getint implicitly relies on other
input-gathering functions to read and skip over any non-integer data.
