The integration of pointers, arrays, and address arithmetic includes the
transparent scaling of pointer arithmetic to account for the sizes of the
objects pointed to.

p. 101

In the alloc function, when the integer ALLOCSIZE is added to allocbuf, since
allocbuf is a pointer, ALLOCSIZE is scaled by the size of the type of object to
which allocbuf points (char).  Since the size of char is one byte, ALLOCSIZE is
multiplied by sizeof char == 1.
