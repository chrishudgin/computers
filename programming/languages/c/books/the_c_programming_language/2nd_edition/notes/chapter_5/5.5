p. 104

Since the assignment operator = does not perform a string copy, an array of
char can only be initialized to contain a string literal once, in the
declaration section of a block.

This statement is legal:

char message[] = "some string";

but a subsequent statement like the following is not legal:

message = "a different string";

However, as the book notes, the contents of the array can later be modified:

message[3] = 'b';
strcpy(message, "a new string");

In contrast, a char pointer declared to point to a string literal can be
modified to point to a different char, but the literal string to which it
pointed at initialization cannot be modified.
