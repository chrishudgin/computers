Pointers other than pointers to void are required to point to a specific data
type for at least two reasons:

1. So that the compiler will know the size and type of data to access when a
pointer is dereferenced.

2. To facliitate pointer arithmetic, which requires knowledge of the size of
the object to which a pointer points as a multiplier.

p. 95

The meaning of *ip++ without parentheses would be *(ip++), meaning

*ip  (dereference ip)
ip++ (... then increment ip)

NOT

++ip (increment ip)
*ip  (... then dereference ip)

and NOT

*ip   (dereference ip)
*ip++ (... then increment *ip)

This is because the post-increment and post-decrement operators ++ and -- are
only applied after the variable they modify (in this case, ip) has been used in
an expression, and this happens in *ip++ only after ip has been dereferenced.
