Situations in which pointers are indispensable include the linking of data
elements in non-linear data structures like trees and in passing data by
"reference" without the use of external variables.  An example in which
pointers can lead to more efficient code is stepping through a
multi-dimensional array.

An ANSI C rule regarding pointers is that pointers and integer types are no
longer implicitly interchangeable except for the value 0.
