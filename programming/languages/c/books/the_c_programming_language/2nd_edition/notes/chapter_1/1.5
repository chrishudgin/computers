"You will find that many programs are just expanded versions of the prototypes
that we discuss here."

For example, on Unix systems, "cat" is an expanded file copying program and
"wc" is an expanded program for counting characters, words, and lines in input.
"sed" is one program that can accomplish what the program to be written for
Exercise 1-12 must do, printing a newline after each input word by substituting
each string of one or more space and/or tab characters with a single newline
character.

Note that the getchar() function returns a value of type int, not char.
Likewise, the putchar() function takes an argument of type int and returns a
value of type int.
