"++nc" could potentially be more efficient than "nc = nc + 1" when compiled
into assembly language if the compiler assembles "++nc" into an
increment-in-place (e.g. INC) instruction and "nc = nc + 1" into a sequence of
a load, add immediate, and store instruction.  An increment instruction with an
optimizing compiler could even choose to increment the value of nc in a
register without writing back to main memory.  On the other hand, the
load-add-store instruction sequence would be necessary if nc were declared as
volatile, meaning its value would have to be fetched from memory external to
the CPU before modification.
