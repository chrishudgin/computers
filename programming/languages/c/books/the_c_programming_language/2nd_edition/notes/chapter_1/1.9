"By testing the length and the last character returned, main can determine
whether the line was too long, and then cope as it wishes."

For example, main might need to continue reading the rest of the long line
either to discard the remainder or to process it as an extension of the line.
Otherwise, the next call to getline will simply continue reading from the same
long line at the point where it left off after the previous call.
