'A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n" is called a
_character string_ or _string constant_.'

A literal string in a C program should indeed be treated as a constant, meaning
no attempt should be made to modify it or any part of it.  Per the ANSI C
standard (section 6.1.4), attempting to modify a string literal results in
undefined behavior.  Unix-like systems may place a program's string constants
in a read-only memory segment to prevent modification, but this convention is
not guaranteed.

p. 8

"There is a complete list [of escape sequences] in Section 2.3."

If any escape sequence not specified by the C language is used, the behavior is
undefined.
