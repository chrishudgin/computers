'A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n" is called a
_character string_ or _string constant_.'

A literal string in a C program is indeed treated as a constant, meaning it
cannot be modified through, for example, pointer dereferencing.  In fact,
Unix-like systems typically place a program's string constants in a read-only
memory segment when the program runs.
