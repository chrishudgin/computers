'A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n" is called a
_character string_ or _string constant_.'

A literal string in a C program should indeed be treated as a constant, meaning
no attempt should be made to modify it or any part of it through, for example,
array element assignment or pointer dereferencing.  Per the ANSI C standard
(section 6.1.4), attempting to modify a string literal results in undefined
behavior.  Unix-like systems may place a program's string constants in a
read-only memory segment to prevent modification, but this convention is not
guaranteed.
