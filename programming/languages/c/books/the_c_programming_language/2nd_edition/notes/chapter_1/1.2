“Comments may appear anywhere a blank or tab or newline can.”

This does therefore impose some restrictions about where comments can appear--
not in the middle of a variable name, for example.

"In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usuaully at the
beginning of a function before any executable statements."

In ANSI C, all variable declarations that are made within a block must appear
at the beginning of the block, except for declarations that are made within a
nested block and are local to that nested block, which must occur at the
beginning of the nested block.

Later versions of the C standard allow variables to be declared after one or
more executable statements, as long as the variables are declared before they
are used.

“%6d	print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide”

Format width specifiers to printf determine the minimum printed width of a
field, not the maximum. Thus, "%6d" means "at least six characters wide, with a
larger width being used if necessary".  For negative numbers, a leading
negative sign (-) is counted as part of the field width.  For floating point
numbers, the decimal point (if printed) is counted as part of the field width.
