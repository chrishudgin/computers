A declaration of a variable is also its definition unless the declaration is
preceded by the "extern" keyword, which specifies that the variable is defined
elsewhere.

"... it destroys the generality of two useful functions by wiring into them the
names of the variables they manipulate."

Using external variables in the place of function parameters defeats the
principle of encapsulation and thus also limits code reuse.
