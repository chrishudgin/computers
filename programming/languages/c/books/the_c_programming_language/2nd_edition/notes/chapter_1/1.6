p. 22

"A subscript can be any integer expression, which includes integer variables
like i, and integer constants."

This is a specific example of how integer-valued expressions may be used where
integers are syntactically legal in C.  Where integer constants are required by
the language, such as in "case" labels for "switch" statements, integer-valued
constant expressions may be used.

While an array subscript can be any nonnegative integer expression, an array
variable definition must specify the array's size using a constant nonnegative
integer expression, or else there must be a constant-valued initializer for the
array so that the array's size can be computed at compile time.
