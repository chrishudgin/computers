“The initialization, condition, and increment can be any expressions.”

In particular, the expressions do not have to be assignment (=), relational
(<=, etc.), or value-incrementing expressions.  Moreoever, all three
expressions in a "for" loop are optional.  The following is therefore legal
syntax to specify the start of a "for" loop:

for (;;)

If the middle expression is omitted, a nonzero constant value is subsituted for
it, meaning that it will always evaluate to true and the loop will be infinite.

*****

“The for is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and
increment are single statements and logically related”

This statement (correctly) implies that the initialization and increment in a
"for" loop do not have to be single statements; indeed, they can each be
multiple comma-separated statements and do not have to be logically related.
