“The initialization, condition, and increment can be any expressions.”

In particular, the expressions do not have to be assignment (=) or relational
(<=, etc.) expressions.  Expressions in "for" loops and elsewhere can also be
empty.  Thus, this "forever" loop statement is legal in C:

for (;;)

*****

“The for is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and
increment are single statements and logically related”

This statement (correctly) implies that the initialization and increment in a
"for" loop do not have to be single statements; indeed, they can each be
multiple comma-separated statements and do not have to be logically related.
