Note that the precedence of the && operator is higher than that of the ||
operator even though both are logically related to each other.  The higher
precedence of && allows conditions that must all be true at the same time to be
grouped together for purposes of evaluation without requiring an extra set of
surrounding parentheses to make their grouping syntactically explicit.

Example:

The following expression:

(a == b) && (c == d) && (e == f) || (g == h) && (i == j)

is equivalent to:

( (a == b) && (c == d) && (e == f) ) || ( (e == f) && (g == h) )
