"Function definitions can appear... in one source file or several...."

This does not mean that the definition of a single function can appear in
multiple source files in the same program.  Functions, like variables, can only
be defined once in a program.  However, they can be declared more than once, as
in function prototypes, as long as the types used in all of the declarations
and defintions for a given function match each other.

*****

"It is an error if the definition of a function or any uses of it do not agree
with its prototype."

It is, however, not necessarily treated as an error or even a warning by the
compiler if the types of a function's parameters do not match the types of the
arguments sent to it.  Some type conversions, such as trunctating floating
point arguments for use as integer parameters, may be done silently even if
there is, strictly speaking, a type mismatch.  Program verifiers like "lint"
and its relatives may catch such type mismatches and emit diagnostic messages
when they are found, even if a given compiler does not.
