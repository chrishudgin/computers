“... the run-time library required to implement self-contained programs is
tiny.”

On Unix-like systems, the runtime library required for self-contained programs
is provided by the crt*.o object files (where "crt" means "C runtime").  These
are responsible for such tasks as setting the initial values of the stack and
frame pointer registers and calling main() and exit().

“The standard makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of
constants that characterize the machine on which the program is run.”

These constants with machine-specific values such as LONG_MAX and DBL_MAX are
defined in limits.h and float.h.  The standard sets minimum (most limiting)
values that these constants can have.
