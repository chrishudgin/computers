"C provides a variety of data types."

This allows C to make efficient use of various machine word sizes and the
corresponding machine instructions for data transfer and data manipulation of
various-sized quantities.  C also faciltates byte-level addressing, unlike its
predecessor B that could only address data in word-sized quantities.

“Because the data types and control structures provided by C are supported
directly by most computers, the run-time library required to implement
self-contained programs is tiny.”

Most C statements translate straightforwardly into just a few machine language
instructions on any architecture.  On Unix-like systems, the runtime library
required for self-contained programs is provided by the crt*.o object files
(where "crt" means "C runtime").  These are responsible for such tasks as
setting the initial values of the stack and frame pointer registers and calling
main() and exit().

“The standard makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of
constants that characterize the machine on which the program is run.”

These constants with machine-specific values such as LONG_MAX and DBL_MAX are
defined in limits.h and float.h.  The standard sets minimum (most limiting)
values that these constants can have.
