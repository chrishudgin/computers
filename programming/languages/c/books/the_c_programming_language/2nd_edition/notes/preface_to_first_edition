"C... features economy of expression...."

'C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application.'

In contrast, some programming languages of the time sought to have a verbose,
English-like syntax and were specialized for particular applications.  Examples
included COBOL and SQL.

"We are also indebted to... Mike Lesk and Joe Ossanna for invaluable assistance
with typesetting."

Joe Ossanna wrote the Unix program troff for typesetting documents, and Mike
Lesk wrote the "ms" troff macros for easier typesetting of manuscripts.  As
indicated on the copyright page, the book was typeset using "troff -ms".
