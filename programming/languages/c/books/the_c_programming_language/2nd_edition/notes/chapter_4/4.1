"A program is just a set of definitions of variables and functions."

That is, after preprocessing is done, what is left outside of functions, if
anything, is variable definitions (along with any additional external
declarations of functions or variables).

p. 72

If atof is compiled separately from main *and* there is no function prototype
for atof in the file that contains main, then the compiler considers atof
implicitly declared in the file that contains main and assumes when compiling
that file that atof returns an int.  Mismatches between function declarations
can only be caught (if at all) during compilation, not during linking of
already-compiled object files.

p. 73

In atoi, the (int) cast of the return value of atof is not necessary for the
compiler to convert the return value to an int as it is returned to the calling
function, since the return type of atoi is already declared as int.  The cast
is merely to suppress any compiler warning about a type mismatch for the return
value.
