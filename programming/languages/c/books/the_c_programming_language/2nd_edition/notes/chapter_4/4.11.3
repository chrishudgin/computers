p. 91

As implied in the text, almost any type of constant integer expression can be
evaluated by an #if statement during preprocessing.

p. 91

#if statements can be nested, as in the following example of a file
hypothetically named "myhdr.h":

#if !defined(MYHDR)  /* equivalently, #ifndef MYHDR */
#define MYHDR
...
#if FOO == BAR
#include "foo.h"  /* foo.h may itself #include "myhdr.h" */
#endif /* FOO == BAR */
...
#endif /* !defined(HDR) */

With such a structure, the header file can safely be used as the target file of
an #include directive more than once in the same source file, directly or
indirectly (through other header files that #include myhdr.h), since all
statements between the first and last in myhdr.h will be ignored (not actually
included) for each #include "myhdr.h" directive the preprocessor encounters
after the first one in a given source file.
