Note that macro substitutions are only made for precisely matching tokens and
are not made within quoted strings, such as a string used as the first argument
to printf.

p. 90

One example in which it might be desirable to #undef a macro that overrides a
function name so that the actual function is used is when a pointer to that
function is needed, since macro expansions do not have addresses.

p.90

Formal parameters are not replaced within quoted strings in the replacement
text part of a macro definition.  Thus:

#define  dprint(expr)   printf("#expr = %g\n", expr)

if invoked as:

dprint(x/y);

would be be replaced by:

printf("#expr = %g\n", x/y);

NOT

printf("x/y = %g\n", x/y);
