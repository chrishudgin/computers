"A C program consists of a set of external objects, which are either variables
or functions."

This statement is similar to a statement in section 4.1 that "a program is just
a set of definitions of variables and functions."

p. 73

External linkage means that, by default, external objects are linked to each
other by name across files within a program.  This behavior can be changed from
the default by adding the keyword "static" to the declaration of an external
variable or a function, which gives the declared object file scope instead of
global scope.
