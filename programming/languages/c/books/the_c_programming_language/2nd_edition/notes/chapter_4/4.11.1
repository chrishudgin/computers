Headers do not have to be implemented as files, as long as their contents can
be included by some mechanism in source files by the preprocessor.

p. 89

"[#include] guarantees that all the source files will be supplied with the
same definitions and variable declarations...."

The #include mechanism performs a literal copying of header lines into a source
file, and those lines can contain any valid C or C preprocessor syntax.
However, "definitions" in an included file would typically be #define macros,
not definitions of variables or functions.  This is because C preprocessor
macros have scope only to the end of a file from the point they are defined and
can therefore be included in multiple source files in the same program, while
non-static external variables and non-static functions have global scope and
can only be defined legally once in a program.

p. 89

Note that macro substitutions are only made for tokens and are not made within
quoted strings, such as a string used as the first argument to printf.
