char is the only integer type whose size in bits (8) is precisely specified by
the language.  All larger integer types must be at least large enough to hold a
certain specified minimum range of values, but may be larger.

Whether the char type is signed or unsigned is implementation dependent.  For
example, char is typically signed on x86 platforms but unsigned on ARM
platforms.  Other integer types are signed unless qualified as unsigned in
their declarations.
