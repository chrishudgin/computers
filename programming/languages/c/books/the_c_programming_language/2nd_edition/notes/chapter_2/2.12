'Function calls, nested assignment statements, and increment and decrement
operators cause "side effects"--some variable is changed as a by-product of the
evaluation of an expression.'

Although the above statement is true, the ANSI C Standard, section 5.1.2.3,
further clarifies what side effects are:

"Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling
a function that does any of those operations are all side effects, which are
changes in the state of the execution environment."

In particular, note that any assignment statement produces a side effect, not
just a nested assignment statement.
