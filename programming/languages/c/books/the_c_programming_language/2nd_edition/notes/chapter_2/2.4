"... certain declarations can be made implicitly by context"

Examples include variables that are not declared explicitly (such as in
pre-ANSI style function declarations) which are assumed to be of type int and
functions that are not declared explicitly which are assumed to take no
parameters and return int.

A modifier of "const" applied to an array declaration means that the elements
of the array are of a constant type (such as const int or const char).
