The standard type conversions for arithmetic types are summarized here.

-1L < 1U for sizeof(int) == 16 and sizeof(long) == 32

In this example, the unsigned integer on right is promoted to a signed long for
comparison.

-1L > 1UL

This is an example of when a signed long int may be converted to an unsigned
long int before comparison with another unsigned long int.  This happens
because both operands of integer type are of the same size, but one is signed
and the other is unsigned.

The standard type conversions occur for arguments passed to functions.  For
example, a function that takes an argument of type "int" can accept a value of
type "char", and a function that takes an argument of type "double" can accept
a value of type "float".  In each case, type promotion takes place.
