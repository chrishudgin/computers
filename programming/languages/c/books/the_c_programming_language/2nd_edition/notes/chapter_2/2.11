In a conditional expression

expr1 ? expr2 : expr3

the type of the result is always subject to the conversion rules applied to the
types of expr2 and expr3 (as though they were the two operands in a binary
operation).  This means, for example, that the type of the result could be that
of expr3 even if expr1 is true, or that the type of the result could be that of
expr2 even if expr1 is false.  This behavior is a consequence of the fact that
a conditional expression is an expression (so it has a type), and an expression
can have only one type, determined at compile time, regardless of the result of
its evaluation.
