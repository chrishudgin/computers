A character constant in the form '\ooo', where the leading 'o' is not a literal
'x' character, is always interpreted as octal, even if the leading 'o'
character is not a literal 0.  At least one octal digit must be given after
the '\', but it is not required to specify all three octal digits for smaller
octal values.

Similarly, a character constant in the form '\xhh', where the leading 'x' is a
literal 'x' character, is interpreted as hexadecimal, even though it is not
written in the form 0xhh.  At least one hexadecimal digit must be given after
the '\', but it is not required to specify both hexadecimal digits for a
hexadecimal value less than or equal to F.
