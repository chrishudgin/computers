"Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values."

This is an informal description of an expression, not a formal definition.  Not
all expressions match this description.  For example, a function call is an
expression, even though it need not combine variables and constants and need
not produce a value.  If no value is produced by an expression, the type of
that expression is "void".
