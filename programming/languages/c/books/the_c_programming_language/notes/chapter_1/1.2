“Comments may appear anywhere a blank or tab or newline can.”

This does therefore impose some restrictions about where comments can appear--
not in the middle of a variable name, for example.

“%6d	print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide”

Format width specifiers to printf determine the minimum printed width of a
field, not the maximum. Thus, %6d means "at least six characters wide, with a
larger width being used if necessary".  The decimal point itself is counted as
part of the field width.
