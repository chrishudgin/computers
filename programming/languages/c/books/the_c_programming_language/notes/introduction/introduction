“the run-time library required to implement self-contained programs is tiny.”

On Unix-like systems, the runtime library required for self-contained programs
is provided by the crt*.o object files (where "crt" means "C runtime").  These
are responsible for such tasks as setting the initial values of the stack and
frame pointer registers and calling main() and exit().

Although the statement refers to self-contained programs rather than those that
explicitly reference libraries, it was written at a time when static linking
was the norm and demand-paging with shared program text in memory was not.
Thus, an entire program and all the libraries it required would typically have
to be loaded into memory before the program could be executed, and each
instance of a given executable in memory would require a full duplicate memory
allocation.

“The standard makes portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of
constants that characterize the machine on which the program is run.”

These constants with machine-specific values such as LONG_MAX and DBL_MAX are
defined in limits.h and float.h.  The standard sets minimum (most limiting)
values that these constants can have.
