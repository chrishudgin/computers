"The MIPS processors execute the jump or branch instruction and the delay slot
instruction as an indivisible unit. If an exception occurs as a result of
executing the delay slot instruction, the branch or jump instruction is not
executed, and the exception appears to have been caused by the jump or branch
instruction."

As a consequence, setting a breakpoint (which works by triggering a trap when
the instruction at that address is executed) at a delay slot instruction will
cause the breakpoint to be triggered whenever the delay slot instruction is
reached, and the jump is therefore not performed due to the trap at the delay
slot instruction.

To solve this problem, set the breakpoint to one instruction after the delay
slot, and consider putting a nop into the delay slot if you really want to set
a breakpoint at the first "useful" instruction after the loop instruction.
