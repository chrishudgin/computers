The sp register is $29
The fp register is $30 or $s8 (where "$s8" means callee-saved register 8)

The MIPS O32 ABI (which GCC uses by default) does not use the frame pointer in
the way that is typical on other platforms (where the fp points to the "bottom"
of the stack and the sp points to the "top" of the stack).  Instead, in
functions in which the stack pointer can be kept constant in the body of the
function (other than function prologue stack growth and function epilogue stack
shrinkage)--functions that don't need to adjust the stack size dynamically
using alloca(), for example--the frame pointer is simply set to point to the
same location as the stack pointer is.  Thus, even if the frame pointer is used
in the assembly code within the body of a function, it's used just as the stack
pointer would be since they both point to the same location.  Use of the frame
pointer is therefore OPTIONAL in most functions, even though it is still saved
at function entry and restored at function exit.
