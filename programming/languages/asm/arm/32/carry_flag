The carry flag can be used as an "unsigned overflow" condition.  It can also be
used to record whether a borrow would have been needed during a subtraction.

The SUBS (subtract and set flags) instruction uses an inverted meaning for the
carry flag such that:

If there was *no* borrow: CF <- 1

If there was a borrow, CF <- 0

The same is true for the CMP instruction, which is implicitly a SUBS that
discards the result of the subtraction itself and only sets flags.

The ADC (add with carry) and SBC (subtract with carry) both take into account
the value of the carry flag and can be used as the second and subsequent steps
in a multi-step series of additions or subtractions (adding or subtracting
multi-word numbers).

If the carry flag is set during a sequence of additions, meaning a carry of one
occurred in the previous addition that set flags (ADDS or ADCS), then ADC adds
it to the sum.

If the carry flag is not set during a sequence of subtractions, meaning a
borrow of one occurred in the previous subtraction that set flags (SUBS or
SBCS), then SBC inverts the value of the carry flag and subtracts it from the
difference.

Sequentially, a multi-word addition should be performed as:
ADDS lowest-order two words
ADCS next highest two words
ADCS next highest two words
...

and a multi-word subtraction should be performed as:
SUBS lowest-order two words
SBCS next highest two words
SBCS next highest two words
...

The carry flag is also set during shift and rotate operations; it is the last
bit shifted or rotated out in either direction.
