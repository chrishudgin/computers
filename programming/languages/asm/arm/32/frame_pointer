By convention, r11 is used as the frame pointer.  However, this is not
mandatory, and in gdb, it is not consistent during execution of a program in
the debugger (displayed value of "fp" does not always equal value of r11).

gdb is "smart" enough to set the displayed value for fp to the actual value for
sp whenever a function is entered.  However, the actual value for r11 does not
change when an ARM bl instruction is executed (branch and link into a function).

To avoid confusion, query r11 rather than "fp" when debugging ARM 32-bit code
in gdb.
