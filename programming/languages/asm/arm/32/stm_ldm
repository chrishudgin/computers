All STM instructions, regardless of suffix (IB, IA, DB, DA), store the
specified registers in register number order (not necessarily the order
specified in the register list in the assembly source) from lowest numbered
register to highest, such that the lowest numbered register occupies the lowest
memory address after the multiple stores are complete.

The LDM instructions assume this memory ordering as well when loading values
into registers.

The default stack orientation on ARM is "full descending", meaning the stack
pointer points to a word that is occupied by data (rather than being empty and
available for new data), and the stack grows downward toward lower memory
addresses.  The default STM and LDM suffix is thus "FD", which is equivalent to
STMDB / LDMIA.
