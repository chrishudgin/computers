The "greater than / less than" (GT, LT and related GE, LE) conditional
execution opcode suffixes' comparisons apply to signed values and check the V
(overflow), N (negative), and Z (zero) flags.

The corresponding unsigned comparison suffixes are HI (higher than) and LS
(lower than or same), and the related HS (higher or same) and LO (lower than)
which check the C (carry) and Z (zero) flags.
