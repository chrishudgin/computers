TST can be used to check whether or not any "set" bits (bits equal to 1) match
up in two operands.  If the zero flag gets set, none of the "set" bits (if
there are any) match.  TST performs an AND operation and sets flags.

TEQ can be used to check whether or not all bits (0 or 1) match up in two
operands.  If the zero flag gets set, then all of the bits match (i.e. the
operands have identical values).  TEQ performs an EOR operation and sets flags.
