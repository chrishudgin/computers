TST can be used to check whether or not any "set" bits (bits equal to 1) match
up in two operands.  If none of the "set" bits (if there are any) match, the
zero flag gets set.  If any of the "set" bits match, the zero flag gets
cleared.  TST performs an AND operation and sets flags.

TEQ can be used to check whether or not all bits (0 or 1) match up in two
operands.  If all of the bits match (i.e. the operands have identical values),
then the zero flag gets set.  Otherwise, the zero flag is cleared.  TEQ
performs an EOR operation and sets flags.
