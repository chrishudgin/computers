ldrex / strex (ARMv6 and later)

This is an implementation of "load-link / store-conditional" as with
the ll/sc instructions on MIPS.  These instructions are better suited to a
RISC pipeline than an instruction like compare-and-swap which must atomically
perform a load, compare, and possibly a store.
