ARM32:

The names of VFP instructions changed with the introduction of Unified Assembly
Language (UAL).  For comparison, see chapter C4 of the ARM Architecture
Reference Manual Issue I (document DDI 0100I) for the old syntax and section
D8.2 of the ARM Architecture Refrence Manual ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition
(document DDI 0406C.c) for the new syntax.

As a consequence of this change, assembly programs written to use UAL may be
assembled by a modern assembler on older (pre-ARMv7) architectures like ARMv6,
even though their processors' technical reference manuals may make references
only to the old instruction names that were in use when those manuals were
written.

ARM64:

ARM64 (AArch64) uses the old names of VFP instructions (FADD, etc.).  See the
ARM Architecture Reference Manual ARMv8 for ARMv8-A architecture profile
(document DDI0487) for the syntax.
