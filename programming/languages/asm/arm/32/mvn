MVN Operand1, Operand2[, optional shift operation]

The MVN instruction is called "Move Negative" in ARM literature, but
functionally it performs a "MOVE NOT", meaning that it performs a bitwise
negation, i.e. a bit flip (not the arithmetic negation which would be the two's
complement) of operand 2 before copying the value to the destination register
specified by operand 1.

To place a negative number into a register, use its two's complement
minus 1 (which is just a bit flip) as operand2 to MVN.  For example, to place
the value -10 into a register, use 9 as the argument to MVN.
