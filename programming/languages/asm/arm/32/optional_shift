If an optional shift operation is specified for operand 2, the shift is
performed on operand 2 before anything else is done with the operand by the
instruction.

Example:

mvn	r0, r1, rrx

operates as:

1.  Rotate r1 by 1 bit using rotate right extend (rotates through the Carry bit)
2.  Negate the value in r1 (flip the bits)
3.  Copy the result from r1 to r0
