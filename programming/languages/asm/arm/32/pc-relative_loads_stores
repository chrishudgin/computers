Loads and stores to/from standard integer ARM registers that use a pc-relative
offset address in the instruction are limited to a 12-bit immediate value to
store the offset magnitude, plus one additional bit in the instruction encoding
to specify whether the offset should be added to or subtracted from the pc.
This means that the offset is limited to a range of +4095 to -4095 bytes from
the program counter.

Loads and stores to/from floating point (VFP) ARM registers that use a
pc-relative offset address in the instruction are limited to an 8 bit immediate
value multiplied by 4 (to ensure word alignment) to store the offset magnitude,
plus one additional bit in the instruction encoding to specify whether the
offset should be added to or subtracted from the pc.  This means that the
offset is limited to a range of +1020 to -1020 bytes (+/- 0..255 * 4) from the
word-aligned value of the program counter.
