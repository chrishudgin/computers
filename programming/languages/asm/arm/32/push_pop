The instructions PUSH and POP are aliases for STMDB and LDMIA, respectively,
using the sp (i.e. r13) register as the base register with writeback (!).

The registers are not necessarily loaded and stored in the order given in the
assembly instruction; rather, the lowest-numbered register in the specified
list of registers is used for the lowest memory address, etc.
