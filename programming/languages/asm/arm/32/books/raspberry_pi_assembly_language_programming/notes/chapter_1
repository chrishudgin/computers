ARM Instruction Format

The instruction pipeline described has three stages, as early ARM processors
had.  Later ARM designs have more pipeline stages.  The nominal three stage
pipeline remains integrated into the ISA in that the value read from the PC
register is that of the current instruction plus two, regardless of the number
of hardware pipeline stages.
