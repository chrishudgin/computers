Rotate Right Extend

For an RRX operation, the carry flag is described as being the right of bit 0.
Since RRX is a form of rotation, this is equivalent to treating the carry flag
as being to the left of bit 31 (i.e. to the left of the leftmost bit in the
word).

MOV/MVN

The MOV instruction cannot accept a 16-bit immediate operand as shown in the
example:

MOV   R2, #0x6E3A

When the GNU assembler encounters a MOV (sic) instruction that requires a
16-bit immediate operand, it automatically replaces the specified MOV
instruction with a MOVW instruction since MOVW can accept a 16-bit immediate
operand.
