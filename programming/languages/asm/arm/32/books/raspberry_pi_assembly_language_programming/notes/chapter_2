About Gnome Programmer's Calculator

“The Gnome programmer’s calculator uses 64-bit representations.”

While this is true by default, the calculator can be configured in its
Preferences menu to use a word size of 64 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits, or 8 bits.

Rotate Right Extend

For an RRX operation, the carry flag is described as being the right of bit 0.
Since RRX is a form of rotation, this is equivalent to treating the carry flag
as being to the left of bit 31 (i.e. to the left of the leftmost bit in the
word).

*****

MOV/MVN

The MOV instruction cannot accept a 16-bit immediate operand as shown in the
example:

MOV   R2, #0x6E3A

When the GNU assembler encounters a MOV (sic) instruction that requires a
16-bit immediate operand, it automatically replaces the specified MOV
instruction with a MOVW instruction since MOVW can accept a 16-bit immediate
operand.
