About the CPSR

The SUBS (subtract and set flags) instruction uses an inverted meaning for the
carry flag such that:

If there was *no* borrow: CF <- 1

If there was a borrow, CF <- 0

However, the SBC (subtract with carry) instruction inverts the value of the
carry flag before subtracting it.

Branch on Condition

Table 4-1 contains errors:

LS should be C clear *or* Z set
LE should be Z set *or* N and V differ

Converting Integers to ASCII

Listing 4-7:

The comment on the line "SUBS R5, #1" should read "step R5 by -1"
