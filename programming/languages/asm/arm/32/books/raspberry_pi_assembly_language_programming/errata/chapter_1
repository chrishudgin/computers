Raspberry Pi Memory

The description of PC-relative addressing incorrectly states that addresses
within 4096 bytes of the value of the PC can be addressed.  In fact, the range
is +4095 to -4095 bytes (not words).

“The last “\n” character is how we represent a new line. If we don’t include
this, you must press return to see the text in the terminal window.”

While the '\n' character does flush the output buffer, it is not true that
pressing return will also flush it.  Leaving out the '\n' character will simply
cause the next output to be appended directly after what preceded it, on the
same line.
