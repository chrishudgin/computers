In the opening paragraph, a reference is made without further elaboration to a
GCC capability of passing information to a program when it is called from the
command prompt.  This may be referring to the libc capabilities of reading
command line arguments through argv or reading input from stdin using (e.g.)
scanf, as explained in chapter 19.  It does not appear to be referring to
directives and macros, the topic of chapter 18.
