Some examples of instructions encoded according to the formats listed in Figure
29a are:

Immediate Operand:  ORR (immediate)

Immediate Shift Operand:  ORR (register)

Register Operand Shift:  SUB (register-shifted register)

*****

In the section "Pipeline", the "forwarding" to which the text alludes is
"operand forwarding" in which the dependent instruction can obtain results in
registers from the previous instruction without waiting for the writeback stage
of the pipeline to complete for the previous instructio (writeback of the
previous instruction occurs in parallel).  In effect, the results of the
previous instruction are "forwarded" to the dependent instruction before they
are written back.
