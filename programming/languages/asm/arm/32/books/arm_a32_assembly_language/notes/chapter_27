In Program 27a, the .flags value for the open call to /dev/mem is 06010002 in 
octal, which corresponds to the following flags in
/usr/include/asm-generic/fcntl.h:

O_SYNC|O_CLOEXEC|O_DSYNC|O_RDWR

The actual arguments given to mmap are:
R0: 0 => kernel chooses base virtual address
R1: 4096 => length of mapped memory (one page)
R2: 3 => the memory protection (int prot) argument:
   PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE = 0x1 | 0x2 = 3
   where the protection values are defined in
   /usr/include/asm-generic/mman-common.h
R3: 1 => MAP_SHARED
   where the MAP_SHARED value is defined in
   /usr/include/asm-generic/mman-common.h
[SP]: file descriptor from open(2)
[SP, #4]: .gpiobase (address offset into /dev/mem for start of mapping)

Character sequence \000 in "/dev/mem\000" is interpreted by the GNU assembler
as the ASCII NUL character.

In section "Virtual Memory", the reason syscall 192 (mmap2) does not work with
the exactly same arguments as the glibc wrapper function mmap is because mmap2
interprets its final argument as a number of 4096 byte pages rather than as a
number of bytes.  This is explained in the mmap2(2) man page.
