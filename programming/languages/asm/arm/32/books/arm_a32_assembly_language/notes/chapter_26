In the section "New A32 Instructions", note that MOVW overwrites the high order
16 bits (bits 16:31) of the destination register with zeroes, but the MOVT
instruction preserves the low order 16 bits (bits 0:15) of the destination
register.  Thus, loading a 32-bit value by decomposing it into two 16-bit
immediate values can be accomplished with a MOVW instruction followed by a MOVT
instruction (but not the other way around).
