In section "The Disassembler", Figure 14c (gdb disassembly of prog10a _start)
is missing from the book.

It should look something like this:

(gdb) disassemble _start
Dump of assembler code for function _start:
   0x00010074 <+0>:	mov	r6, #215	; 0xd7
   0x00010078 <+4>:	mov	r10, #1
   0x0001007c <+8>:	lsl	r9, r10, #31
   0x00010080 <+12>:	ldr	r1, [pc, #60]	; 0x100c4 <_write+20>
End of assembler dump.

*****

In section "The Disassembler", the command:

Disassemble /r 0x8084, 0x80a0

should be:

disassemble /r 0x8084, 0x80a0

since gdb commands are case sensitive.

*****

In section "Breakpoints", the source code in the book is slightly different
from what is provided on the author's web site in the code downloads, so the
line numbers and the constant in r6 will differ as well.

*****

In section "Memory Dump", giant words are eight bytes, not "eighth" bytes.

*****

In section "Memory Dump", the default value for unit on ARM32 is w (word), not
"1".
