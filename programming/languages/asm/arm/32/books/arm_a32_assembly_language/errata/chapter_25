In the opening section of the chapter, the reference to Figure 5c in Chapter 6
should be to that figure in Chapter 5.

*****

In the section "Differences", the reference to the BL instruction should be to
the BX instruction.

*****

In the section "Differences", the BX instruction (incorrectly given as BL) can
use a full 32-bit register to specify a target address, allowing a target
anywhere in the 32-bit address space (not limited to +/- 4 MB).

*****

In the section "Single and Multi-Register", the example for Load/Store Register
addressing should have brackets around the operand R1:

LDR R0, [R1]

*****

In the section "New ARMv7 Instructions", the statement that the CBZ and CBNZ
instructions accept .N or .W suffixes is incorrect.  They are strictly 16-bit
Thumb instructions.
