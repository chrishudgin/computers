In the section "Thumb Changes", the first LDMIA instruction should be:

LDMIA R0!, {R1, R2}

*****

In the section "New A32 Instructions", neither the syntax nor the descrption of
the operation of the example BFI instruction is correct.  The instruction:

BFI R0, R1, #5, #3

will copy the low-order 3 bits (that is, bits 0,1,2) from R1 into R0, starting
at bit 5 in R0 (but not in R1).

*****

In the section "New A32 Instructions", the stated order of operations for the
MLS instruction is incorrect.  The product is subtracted from the last register
specified, and the least significant 32 bits of the result are written into the
destination register.

*****

In Figure 26a, the "MOV" mnemonic should be "MOVW".
