In Figure 29c, the "result" fields for SBC and RSC are incorrect.

SBC should be: Rd = Op1 - Op2 - (C ? 1 : 0)
RSC should be: Rd = Op2 - Op1 - (C ? 1 : 0)

That is, if the carry flag (C) is set, reduce the result of the subtraction by
1.

*****

Figure 29d incorrectly shows the imm3 field occupying four bits.  In fact, it
occupies three bits.  There should be a zero shown in bit 15.

*****

In the section "Instruction Cycles", the vld1.32 instruction is written
incorrectly as "vlf1.32".
