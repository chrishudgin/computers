In the section "Modes of Operation", the text incorrectly refers to six modes
of ARM operation.  In fact, there are seven.

Figure 28b incorrectly omits the seventh ARM operating state, "System", which
is a privileged mode for operating system software.

*****

In the section "MRS and MSR", the syntax shown for the MSR instruction is
misleading.  The "Flags" option actually means that some field within the CPSR
register can optionally be selected by itself (rather than the whole CPSR
register) for overwriting.

In the section "MRS and MSR", the ARM Architecture Manual (document DDI
0406C.d) lists only _f, _s, and _fs as valid optional suffixes for the CPSR
register in the MSR instruction when it is executed in User mode, corresponding
to the flags, status, and flags+status fields of the CPSR register.  The other
fields (extension and control) of the CPSR register can only be modified by
instructions executing in modes other than User (i.e. in privileged modes).
