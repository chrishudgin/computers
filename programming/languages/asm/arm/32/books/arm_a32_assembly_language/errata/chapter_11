In the section "Rotations", the author uses the word "shuffle" as a synonym for
"shift or rotate" without implying randomization.

In the example of rotating right by four bits, the copy of the last bit out
that is placed in the Carry Flag is actually bit 3 if counting the bits right
to left from 0.

*****

In the section "Extended Rotate", the sentence:

"There is also an extended version or Rotate Right...."

should read:

"There is also an extended version of Rotate Right...."

*****

In the section "Uses of Shifts and Rotates", the text should state that the LDR
and STR operations are described in chapter 15, not chapter 13.
