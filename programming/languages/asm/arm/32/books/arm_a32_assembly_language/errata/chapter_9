In table 9a of conditional execution suffixes, PL actually means "plus or
zero", i.e. Minus clear (N flag clear).

Under the topic "Single Flag Condition Codes", CS (carry set) should be
included in the list before CC (carry clear).

In the description of the NE conditional execution suffix, subtracting two
unlike numbers will only clear the Zero flag if the S suffix was included in
the instruction (e.g. SUBS) or if the subtraction was done implicitly by an
instruction that always sets flags (like CMP).

In the description of the PL conditional execution suffix, the reference to a
CMP instruction should instead refer to the SUBS instruction in the example
code.

In the description of the LS conditional execution suffix, it should state that
the instruction will be executed if the Carry flag is clear *or* the Zero flag
is set.
