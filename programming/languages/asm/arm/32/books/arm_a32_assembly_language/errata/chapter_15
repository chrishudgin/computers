In the section "Pre-Indexed Addressing", the syntax statements for LDR and STR
are not correct.  They should read:

LDR (<suffix>) <destination>, [<source>,(<offset>)]
STR (<suffix>) <source>, [<destination>,(<offset>)]

where source and destination are registers and offset is either an immediate
value or a register.

*****

In the section "Pre-Indexed Addressing", the contant to be loaded in Figure 15d
(0xF80A) does not match the (mistyped and invalid) constant in the accompanying
text (0xFBOA).

*****

In the section "Pre-Indexed Addressing", the description of the following
instruction is incorrect:

LDR R0, [R1, R2, LSL#4]

The value of R2 is shifted right by 4 bits, not by 2 bits as stated in the
book.

*****

prog15b.s:  The initial value of R2 should be #25, not #26, since it is used
as an offset from the first element of the array of characters.

*****

In the section "Accessing Memory Bytes", the description of the PL conditional
execution suffix is incorrect.  PL means "not negative", that is "positive or
zero", not strictly "positive".  Thus, the byte copy will end once R2 becomes
negative, not when R2 reaches zero.
