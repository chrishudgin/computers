Programs 21a, 21c, and 21d in the text (but not in the downloadable source
code) are missing <stdio.h> after the #include directive.

*****

In the program listings in Figures 21b and 21c, there should be a space between
"type" and "main" in ".typemain".

*****

In the section "Frame Pointer Variables", the following instruction:
	LDR R2, {FP, #-8}
should be:
	LDR R2, [FP, #-8]

*****

In the section "Disassembling Syscalls", the reference to lines 3-8 in Figure
21d should be to lines 2-7.  The reference to lines 23-24 should be to lines
24-25.

*****

In the section "Disassembling Syscalls", there is a reference to a "slight
change to the directory name" in Program 21f, but no such change exists in the
program itself (it still uses the relative pathname "tempdir" as did Program
21e).
