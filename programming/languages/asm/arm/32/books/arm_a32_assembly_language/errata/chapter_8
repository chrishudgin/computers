prog8b:
   The book states that the value "#1 LSL #31" (which is 0x80000000) cannot be
   loaded directly into a register due to the constraints imposed on the use of
   immediate values.  In fact, this value can be used as an immediate in an LDR
   instruction because it can be represented as a shifted 8-bit value.

   The description in the book of the logic of the TST and BEQ instruction in
   this program is incorrect.  If the tested bit is set, the "BEQ _print0"
   branch will not be taken and a "1" will be printed.  The program does
   function correctly.
