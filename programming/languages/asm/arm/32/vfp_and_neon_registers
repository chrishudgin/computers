VFPv2 provides 32 single and 16 double precision floating point registers
wherein singles overlap with doubles, such that each double precision register
logically (and alternatively) contains two single precision registers:

From low bits to high bits in each double precision register:

s0 s1 compose d0
s2 s3 compose d1
...
s30 s31 compose d15

*****

In AArch32 mode, the -D32 variants of VFPv3 and later provide 32 single, 32
double, and (with NEON) 16 quad word registers with registers of different
sizes overlapping, such that each quad word register logically (and
alternatively) contains two double word registers, or either four or zero
single word registers:

From low bit to high bits in each quad word register:

s0 s1 s3 s3 or d0 d1 compose q0
s4 s5 s6 s7 or d2 d3 compose q1
...
s28 s29 s30 s31 or d14 d15 compose q7
...
d30 d31 compose q15
