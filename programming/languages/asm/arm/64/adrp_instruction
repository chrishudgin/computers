The ADRP instruction is used to set an address relative to the beginning of the
current instruction's 4k page frame.  To compute the address, it zeroes the 12
low bits of the program counter (yielding the starting address of the page
frame) and adds a signed 21 bit immediate value multiplied by 4096, yielding a
range of +/- 4 GB from the current page frame boundary with a resolution of 4k
(one page).

A precise address within the selected page frame can then be obtained with a
subsequent ADR instruction, which can compute an address offset of +/- 1 MB
using a signed 21-bit immediate value.
