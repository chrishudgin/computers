The ADRP instruction is used to set an address relative to the beginning of the
current instruction's 4k page frame.  To compute the address, it zeroes the 12
low bits of the program counter (yielding the starting address of the current
page frame) and adds a signed 21-bit immediate value multiplied by 4096,
yielding a range of +/- 4 GB from the current page frame boundary with a
resolution of 4k (one page).

A precise address within the selected page frame can then be obtained with a
subsequent ADD immediate or ADD register instruction, adding an offset in bytes
to the address value in the register that was written by the preceding ADRP
instruction.  ADD immediate can encode any offset between 0 and 4095 (bytes),
allowing any byte address within a page to be computed.

Alternatively, for PC-relative address offsets of +/- 1 MB, the ADR instruction
with a 21-bit immediate value can be used instead of an ADRP/ADD instruction
pair.
