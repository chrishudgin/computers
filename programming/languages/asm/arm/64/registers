Registers X0 through X30 are general purpose registers.

Register X29 is the frame pointer if a frame pointer is used.

Register X30 is used as a link register by the BL/BLR instructions and as the
default jump target of the RET instruction.

The binary encoding of register 31 (0b11111) is used for either the stack
pointer (SP) or zero register (XZR/WZR) depending on context.  In assembly
language, it must be named SP or XZR/WZR, not X31.

The program counter (PC) register cannot be used by name in assembly language
instructions.  It is used implicitly in certain instructions such as
PC-relative loads/stores and branches that compute addresses using offsets from
the current value of the program counter.
