A conditional branch instruction (B.GT, B.CS, etc.) has an offset computed
using a 19-bit signed immediate value times 4, yielding a range of +/- 1 MB
from the current instruction with a granularity of 4 bytes.

An unconditional branch instruction (B or BL) has an offset computed using a
signed 26-bit signed immediate value times 4, yielding a range of +/- 128 MB
with a granularity of 4 bytes.
