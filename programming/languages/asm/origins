The term "assembly language" comes from the fact that the assembler "assembles"
the fields in each assembly language statement into a machine instruction.

The term "assembly" in this context was first used in a 1949 paper by Maurice
Wilkes on the EDSAC.

The invention of assembly language notation is credited to Kathleen Booth, a
British computer scientist, in 1947.
