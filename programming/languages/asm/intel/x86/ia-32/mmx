MMX instructions were originally designed to use the low-order 64 bits of each
"st" register as an "mm" register, mm0 - mm7, for SIMD integer instructions.
However, the use of the MMX registers for MMX instructions is deprecated on
CPUs with SSE2 registers since MMX instructions are permitted (though not
required) to use those registers instead, leaving the st registers free for
scalar floating point operations.
