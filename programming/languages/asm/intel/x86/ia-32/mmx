MMX instructions were originally designed to use the low-order 64 bits of each
"st" register as an "mm" register, mm0 - mm7, for SIMD integer instructions,
but the use of the MMX registers for MMX instructions is deprecated on CPUs
with SSE2 registers since MMX instructions are permitted to use those
registers, leaving the st registers free for scalar floating point operations.
