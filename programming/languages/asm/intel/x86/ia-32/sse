Multi-byte values in the SSE registers are each stored in little-endian byte
order.  Multiple indexed values in the SSE registers are also stored in
little-endian order (lowest index first, i.e. to the left).  These statements
can be verified by writing the contents of an SSE register to memory (as with
MOVDQA or MOVAPS) and then examining the memory contents byte by byte.
