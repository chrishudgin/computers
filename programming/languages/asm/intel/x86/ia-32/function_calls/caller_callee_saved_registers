Caller-saved registers:

eax
ecx
edx

To save values of other registers, push them onto the stack before pushing the
callee function's parameters.  After returning from the callee function, move
the stack pointer back to the location of the most recently saved register and
pop the registers from the stack in the reverse of the order in which they were
pushed.

Callee-saved registers:

ebx
edi
esi
ebp
esp

From Wikipedia article "x86 calling conventions":

The x87 floating point registers ST0 to ST7 must be empty (popped or freed)
when calling a new function, and ST1 to ST7 must be empty on exiting a
function. ST0 must also be empty when not used for returning a value.
