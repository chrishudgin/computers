Both NASM and GAS accept "0x" as a prefix for hexadecimal constants, as in
   "0x80".

NASM also accepts "h" as a suffix for hexadecimal constants, as in "80h",
   but beware that "ah", "bh", "ch", and "dh" are interpreted as registers,
   not constants.

An alternative in NASM to using a "0x" prefix is to use a "0" prefix together
   with an "h" suffix, so that, for example, "0ah" unambiguously refers to
   the hexadecimal constant "A" rather than register AH.
