Accesses to data through SSE instructions must be aligned.  Accesses to data
through instructions in the base instruction set (non-SSE) do not have to be
aligned.

GCC aligns the stack on a 16-byte boundary when calling a function, as required
by SSE instructions.

GCC also aligns functions on 16-byte boundaries by default (configurable with
-falign-functions[=n]), appending the minimum number of NOP (or equivalent)
and NOPW (longer instruction length NOP) instructions where necessary to
achieve that alignment before the start of a function.
