An x87 stack push has the following effects if the stack does not overflow as
a result of the push:

The stack register pointed to by the top-of-stack pointer st(0) is decremented
with wraparound (e.g. r7 to r6 or r0 to r7).  The registers pointed to by the
other stack pointers st(1-7) are also decremented with wraparound since their
positions are always by definition sequential relative to st(0).

The value being pushed is stored in the new register pointed to by st(0).  This
register is tagged in the ftag register as occupied.

The values in the other stack registers (r0-r7, except for the one pointed to
by st(0)) are unchanged.
