When an unmasked floating point exception is generated, the contents of the
x87 register stack are unchanged.

Per section 8.7 ("Handling x87 FPU exceptions in software") of the IA-32 Intel
Architecture Software Developer's Manual, it is necessary to attempt to execute
a subsequent floating point instruction (other than a control instruction like
FINIT) after the instruction that generated the exception in order for the
software exception handler (such as would generate a SIGFPE signal) to be
invoked.
