By default (FPU control register bits 10-11 are 0), rounding is done to the
nearest higher or lower value per traditional rounding rules, except when the
two bracketing values that can be represented in the available precision are
equidistant from the value to be rounded, in which case rounding is done to the
nearest even value.
