An x87 stack has the following effects if the stack does not underflow as a
result of the pop:

The values stored in the stack registers (r0-r7) are not changed.

Tags the stack register (r0-r7) currently denoted by st(0) as empty in the ftag
register.

Moves the st(0) top-of-stack pointer up one slot (e.g. from r6 to r7 or r7
wrapping around to r0), causing the other st(1-7) relative stack pointers to
move up one slot (with wraparound) as well since by definition the st1-7
pointers are always sequential relative to st(0).
