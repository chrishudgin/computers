CF (carry flag) is set when an unsigned operation requires a carry or borrow--
   when a computation passes through zero or an upper unsigned representation
   boundary.

OF (overflow flag) is set when a signed operation yields a result of the
   opposite sign than what is arithmetically expected (e.g. add two positives,
   get a negative or add two negatives, get a positive)--when a computation
   passes through an upper or lower signed representation boundary.
