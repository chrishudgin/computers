Greater than / less than comparisons use different instructions for signed
or unsigned values.

ja:  jump if above (unsigned), i.e. if CF=0 and ZF=0
jb:  jump if below (unsigned), i.e. if CF=1

jg:  jump if greater than (signed), i.e. if ZF=0 and SF=OF
jl:  jump if less than (signed), i.e. if SF<>OF
