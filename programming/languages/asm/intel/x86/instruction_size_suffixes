Size suffixes such as B, W, L, and Q to specify operand size for instructions
such as MOV are only required by AT&T syntax, and only when the operand size
cannot be uniquely determined by the assembler based on the instruction or
operand itself.

For example, these instructions do not require a size suffix because their
register operators determine the assumed storage size of the immediate
constant:

mov	$0x10, %al   /* same as movb */
mov	$0x10, %ax   /* same as movw */
mov	$0x10, %eax  /* same as movl */
mov	$0x10, %rax  /* same as movq */
