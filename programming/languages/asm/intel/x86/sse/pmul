The pmulhuw instruction is part of the SSE instruction set even though it
operates on integer values and is effectively the unsigned version of the
pmulhw instruction that is part of MMX.

There is no need for a separate pmulluw instruction as an unsigned version of
pmullw; it would be identical to pmullw since the low order 16 bits are the
same after the multiply regardless of whether the numbers being multiplied are
signed or unsigned.
