By default (MXCSR register bits 13-14 are 0), rounding is done to the nearest
higher or lower value per traditional rounding rules, except when the two
bracketing values that can be represented in the available precision are
equidistant from the value to be rounded, in which case rounding is done to the
nearest even value.
