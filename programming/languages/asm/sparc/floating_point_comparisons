The only floating point instructions that affect the floating point condition
codes (equal, less than, greater than, unordered) are the FCMP(E)s/d/q
instructions, which are in turn used by the floating point conditional branch
instructions, FBfcc (like FBG, FBE, etc.).

There must be at least one non-FCMP instruction (even if it is just a NOP)
placed between any FCMP instruction and a subsequent FBfcc instruction in order
for the FBfcc to branch predictably according to the floating point condition
codes.
