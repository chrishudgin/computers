There are thirty-two 32-bit floating point registers, %f0 through %f31, each
capable of storing a single precision floating point number.  Double precision
floating point numbers are stored in consecutive pairs of floating point
registers, starting with an even-numbered register (e.g. %f0) containing the
high-order 32 bits and the next odd-numbered register (e.g. %f1) containing the
low-order 32 bits (because SPARC is big endian).

GDB refers to even-odd pairs of floating point registers as "d" registers, as:

%d0 is %f0:%f1
%d2 is %f2:%f3
...
%d30 is %f30:%f31

Note that all of the "d" pseudo composite registers recognized by GDB are
evenly numbered.
