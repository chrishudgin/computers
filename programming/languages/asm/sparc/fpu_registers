For SPARC V8, there are thirty-two 32-bit floating point registers, %f0 through
%f31, each capable of storing a single precision floating point number.  Double
precision and quad precision floating point numbers are stored in consecutive
sets of floating point registers, starting with a register number divisble by 2
for double precision (%f0, %f2, ..., %f30) or a register number divisible by 4
for quad precision (%f0, %f4, ..., %f28) containing the high-order word (32
bits) and the next registers in sequence (e.g. if %f0 contains the high-order
word then %f1 for double precision or %f1, %f2, %f3 for quad precision)
containing the lower-order words because SPARC is big-endian.

For SPARC V9, there are also sixteen 64-bit floating point registers %f32,
%f34, ..., %f62 which can be used for double precision values, or alternatively
as %f32:%f34, %f36:%f38, ..., %f60:%f62 for quad precision values.

GDB refers to even-odd pairs of floating point registers as "d" registers, as:

%d0 is %f0:%f1
%d2 is %f2:%f3
...
%d30 is %f30:%f31

Note that all of the "d" pseudo composite floating point registers recognized
by GDB are evenly numbered.

GDB does not provide quad precision pseudo composite floating point registers
(i.e. no "q" registers).
