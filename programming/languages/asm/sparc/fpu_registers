For SPARC V8, there are thirty-two 32-bit floating point registers, %f0 through
%f31, each capable of storing a single precision floating point number.  Double
precision and quad precision floating point numbers are stored in consecutive
sets of floating point registers, starting with a register number divisble by 2
for double precision (%f0, %f2, ...) or a register number divisible by 4 for
quad precision (%f0, %f4, ...)) containing the high-order word (32 bits) and
the next registers in sequence (e.g. if %f0 contains the high-order word then
%f1 for double precision, %f1, %f2, %f3 for quad precision) containing the
%lower-order words because SPARC is big-endian.

For SPARC V9, there are also 64-bit floating point registers %f32, %f34, ...
%f62 which can be used for double precision values, or alternatively %f32 %f34,
%f36 %f38, ... %f60 %f62 for quad precision values.

GDB refers to even-odd pairs of floating point registers as "d" registers, as:

%d0 is %f0:%f1
%d2 is %f2:%f3
...
%d30 is %f30:%f31

Note that all of the "d" pseudo composite registers recognized by GDB are
evenly numbered.
