For SPARC V8, there are thirty-two 32-bit floating point registers, %f0 through
%f31, each capable of storing a single precision floating point number.  Double
precision and quad precision floating point numbers are stored in consecutive
sets of floating point registers, starting with a register number divisble by 2
for double precision (%f0, %f2, ..., %f30) or a register number divisible by 4
for quad precision (%f0, %f4, ..., %f28) containing the high-order word (32
bits) and the next registers in sequence (e.g. if %f0 contains the high-order
word then %f1 for double precision or %f1, %f2, %f3 for quad precision)
containing the lower-order words.  This ordering is consistent with the
big-endianness of SPARC.

For SPARC V9, there are also sixteen 64-bit floating point registers %f32,
%f34, ..., %f62 which can be used for double precision values, or alternatively
as %f32:%f34, %f36:%f38, ..., %f60:%f62 for quad precision values.

GDB provides pseudo-register names beginning with "d" and (for 64-bit
executables) "q" as aliases for the corresponding "f" registers when used for
double or quad precision floating point values, respectively.

For example:

%d0 is %f0:%f1
%q0 is %f0:%f1:%f2:%f3
