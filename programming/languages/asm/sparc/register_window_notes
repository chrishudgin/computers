From page 24 of the _SPARC Architecture Manual, Version 8_:

"No assumptions can be made regarding the values contained in the 'local' and
'out' registers of a register window upon re-entering the window through a SAVE
instruction."

Thus, if a function is re-entered, its local and out register values may not be
preserved from the last time the function was being executed.
