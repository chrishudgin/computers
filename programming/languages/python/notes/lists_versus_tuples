Lists:

Syntactically enclosed by square brackets []
Mutable
Typically contain elements of the same type (e.g. strings or nested lists)
Accessed by iteration, applying the same operation to each list element, as in
    for num in mynumlist:
        print(num**2)


Tuples:

Syntactically enclosed by parentheses ()
Immutable
May contain elements of different types
Accessed by unpacking, e.g. by assigning a sequence of variables to a tuple,
   as in
    mytuple = (1, 2, 3)
    a, b, c = my3tuple
