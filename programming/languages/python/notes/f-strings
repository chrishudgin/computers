F-strings are a shorthand syntax for specifying formatted text strings.  They
are evaluated at runtime and are equivalent to the use of a .format() method
without requiring a function call.

Example:

>>> object = "world"
>>> version = 2
>>> print(f"hello, {object} version {version.1f}")
hello, world 2.0
