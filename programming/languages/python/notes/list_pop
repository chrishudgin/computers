The list.pop method takes an optional argument to specify the index at which
the desired element should be removed.  Thus, pop is not limited to removing an
item from one end of a list or the other but can remove an item from an
arbitary position.

>>> mylist = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> mylist.pop(1)
'b'
>>> mylist.pop(0)
'a'
>>> mylist
['c']
