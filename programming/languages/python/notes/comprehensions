Comprehensions for lists, sets, and dictionaries can be thought of as element
generators that use inline "for" loops and optionally also "if" conditionals to
select elements from a given input.

Example:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> newlist = [elem for elem in x if elem > 1 and elem < 4]
>>> print(newlist)
[2, 3]
