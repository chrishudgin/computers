Exceptions that are not handled within a "try/except" statement (grouping) are
re-raised so they can potentially be caught by an exception handler that was
already defined in an enclosing outer try/except statement.  If there is no
exception handler defined for an exception that occurs, program execution
stops.

When an exception occurs in a function but is handled outside the scope of the
function (because the function has no exception handler for it), the local
namespace of the function is no longer in scope in the exception handler.
