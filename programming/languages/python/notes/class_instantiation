Class instantiation is done by calling the class name as though it were a
function (possibly with arguments) and assigning the result to a variable.

Example:

class foo:
    def __init__(self, steps, instring):
        self.steps = steps
        self.instring = instring

myfoo = foo(4, 'abc')  # instantiate foo class as instance object myfoo
print(myfoo.steps, repr(myfoo.instring))
4 'abc'
