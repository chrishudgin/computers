The "is" operator determines whether two object references (such as variable
names) refer to the same object, as opposed to different objects that may or
may not happen to have the same values as each other.

>>> mydict = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 3}
>>> mydict2 = mydict
>>> print(mydict is mydict2)   # Do they both refer to the same object?
True                           # Yes
>>> mydict2 = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 3}
>>> print(mydict == mydict2)
True                           # They have the same values...
>>> print(mydict is mydict2)
False                          # ... but they are not the same object
