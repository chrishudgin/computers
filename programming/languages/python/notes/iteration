Iterating over the elements of a dictionary can be done with a "for" loop
applied to the dictionary with the resulting key values used as value =
dict[key] to access the value for each key.  To access each key and its value
together, use the dictionary's .items() method, which will return 2-tuples each
containing a key and its value.

Iterating over a set or over a sequence (list or tuple) can be done with a
"for" loop applied to the set or sequence itself.  To access both the index and
the corresponding value in a sequence together, use the enumerate() function
with the sequence as its argument, which will return 2-tuples each containing
an index and its value from the sequence, in sequential order.
