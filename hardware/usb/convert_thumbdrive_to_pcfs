To convert a USB thumb drive to FAT32 from another format on Solaris 10:

svcadm disable volfs
rmformat (find out full path to device)
# rmformat
Looking for devices...
     1. Logical Node: /dev/rdsk/c3t0d0s2
        Physical Node: /pci@1f,0/usb@c,3/storage@3/disk@0,0
        Connected Device: Kingston DataTraveler 2.0 1.00
        Device Type: Removable

fdisk /dev/rdsk/c3t0d0s2
Delete all existing partitions, then create a FAT32 partition taking up
100% of the disk

mkfs -F pcfs -o fat=32 /dev/rdsk/c3t0d0s2:c

Test mounting it:
mount -F pcfs /dev/dsk/c3t0d0s2:c /mnt  (this may take a few moments)
df -k
mount -v
umount /mnt

If you wish to automount the new filesystem:  physically remove the drive,
reinsert it, and re-enable volfs.
