ARM1176JZF-S feature name abbreviation notes:

11: a member of the ARM11 series of processors implementing the ARM11
    microarchitecture and the ARMv6 ISA
7: Cache, MMU, with physical address tagging
6: Tightly coupled SRAM interface (tightly coupled memory, TCM)

J: Jazelle extension (native execution of Java bytecode)
Z: TrustZone security extension (separation of secure and non-secure code)
F: Hardware floating point unit: VFPv2 including floating point vector ops
   On the ARM1176JZF-S, floating point vector arithmetic operations are
      performed sequentially in hardware, NOT in parallel
   IEEE 754 implementation but software support code is needed for some
      calculations like those involving subnormal inputs
S: Synthesizable (chip feature layout can be customized from functional
      description)

ISA notes:

ARMv6KZ architecture
   K: additional synchronization instructions for multiprocessing
         including CLREX, LDREXB/H/D and STREXB/H/D to operate on memory
            operands that are not word-sized, NOP with yield hint
         Note that the LDREX and STREX instructions that operate on word-sized
            memory operands are part of the base ARMv6 ISA and are therefore
            also implemented in processors that conform to the ARMv6K extension
   Z: TrustZone security extension

Thumb support:
   T1 (Thumb-1) instructions are implemented
   T2 (Thumb-2) instructions are NOT implemented

NEON (Advanced SIMD) support:
   Not implemented
