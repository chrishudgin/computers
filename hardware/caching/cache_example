The Raspberry Pi Zero uses an ARM1176JZF-S processor with 16 KB of L1
instruction cache, 16 KB of L1 data cache, and 128 KB of L2 cache.  Each L1
cache and the L2 cache are 4-way set associative with 32 byte cache lines
(thus, four lines or 128 bytes per set).  The L1 caches are virtually indexed
and physically tagged.  The Raspberry Pi Zero has 512 MB of main memory, a 4 KB
page size, and a 32-bit word size.

The lower 12 bits of a virtual address are split into:

5 lower bits (32): address of byte within L1 cache line
7 middle bits (128): index of L1 cache set

The upper 20 bits of the virtual address are translated into a physical address
to produce a tag:

20 upper bits (1,048,576): 512 byte physical memory block selector (tag)
