# apt-get install python-smbus i2c-tools

# raspi-config
Interfacing Options -> P5 I2C -> Enabled (Yes)

Append the following line to /boot/config.txt :
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307

# i2cdetect -y 1 (should show ID #68 in the table)

The following web site :
https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time
recommends commenting out the following lines in /lib/udev/hwclock-set :

if [ -e /run/systemd/system ] ; then
	exit 0
fi

but it may not be necessary to comment out those lines.

# systemctl stop fake-hwclock
# systemctl disable fake-hwclock
# apt-get remove fake-hwclock
# systemctl reboot
# i2cdetect -y 1 (should show "UU" in the entry for ID #68 in the table)

Verify that RTC clock time is correct and NTP time is synced :
# timedatectl

If the RTC clock time needs to be set to the NTP time :
# hwclock -w
