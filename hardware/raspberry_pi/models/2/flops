The Raspberry Pi 2 with a 32-bit ARM Cortex-A7 chip at its default 900 MHz
clock speed has a rating of 154 Linpack MFLOPS for double precision
calculations, just slightly less than the 160 MFLOPS rating for the Cray-1
supercomputer.

When overclocked to a 1 GHz clock speed, the Raspberry Pi 2 has a Linpack
MFLOPS rating of 169, faster than that of the Cray-1.
