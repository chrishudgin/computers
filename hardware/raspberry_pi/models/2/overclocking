Overclock CPU of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B to 1 GHz:

Install heat sinks for CPU and LAN chips.

# raspi-config
4 Performance Options -> P1 Overclock ->
   High 1000MHz ARM, 500MHz core, 500 MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolt
   Might need to set overvolt to 3 manually in /boot/firmware/config.txt
Reboot

To avoid possible kernel errors during patching, turn off CPU overclocking.
