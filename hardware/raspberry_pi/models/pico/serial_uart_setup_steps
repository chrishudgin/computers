Connect GPIO pins from Raspberry Pi 400 to Raspberry Pi Pico as follows:

Serial UART:
Raspberry Pi 400		Raspberry Pi Pico
GND (Pin 14)			GND (Pin 3)
GPIO15 (UART_RX0, Pin 10)	GP0 (UART0_TX, Pin 1)
GPIO14 (UART_TX0, Pin 8)	GP1 (UART0_RX, Pin 2)

Configure the serial port on the Raspberry Pi 400:
$ sudo raspi-config
and go to Interfacing Options â†’ Serial and select "No" when asked "Would you
like a login shell to be accessible over serial?" and "Yes" when asked "Would
you like the serial port hardware to be enabled?"

Connect to the serial port:
$ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/serial0   # serial0 should be a link to ttyS0
