# pip3 install adafruit-ampy

To use MicroPython on the Pico:

Download the latest prebuilt UF2 file for MicroPython from:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-micropython

Copy it to the Pico as with any other UF2 file.

Use ampy to copy files to the Pico, e.g.:

$ ampy -p /dev/serial0 put baz.py main.py
   (copies baz.py from the host to main.py on the Pico)
$ ampy -p /dev/serial0 put foo.py
$ ampy -p /dev/serial0 put bar.py
$ ampy -p /dev/serial0 ls

If there is a MicroPython program on the Pico in a file called main.py, the
MicroPython interpreter will run it automatically when the Pico boots.

Interact with the Pico through the USB serial connection using minicom.  The
MicroPython interpreter installed on the Pico provides the same REPL (read,
evaluate, print, loop) interactive functionality as a standard Python
interpreter:

$ minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/serial0
Hit <Enter> to get a >>> prompt if no MicroPython program is running.
If a MicroPython program is running, hit <Ctrl-C> to stop it and get a prompt.
From the prompt, hit <Ctrl-D> to perform a soft reboot and run main.py.
Use <Ctrl-A> <X> to exit Minicom.
