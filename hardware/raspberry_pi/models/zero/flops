The Raspberry Pi Zero operating at a clock speed of 1 GHz can compute at a rate
of approximately 68 MFLOPS (double precision).  At 700 MHz, the clock speed of
the original Raspberry Pi, its MFLOPS rating is 42.  For comparison, the first
Cray supercomputer, the Cray-1 from the mid-1970s, was rated at 160 MFLOPS and
was at the time the fastest computer in the world.
