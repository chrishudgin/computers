The processing speed of the 1 GHz ARM 1176JZF-S CPU used in the Raspberry Pi
Zero is approximately equivalent to that of the fastest Pentium II (450 MHz)
that Intel produced, starting in 1998.  A name brand (Compaq Presario) complete
Pentium II PC system with 450 MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, 10 GB hard drive,
and 17 inch monitor cost $2500 in 1998.  With 512 MB of RAM and no monitor, the
price would also have been around $2500.

In 2015, a Raspberry Pi Zero with 16 GB microSD card, keyboard, mouse, case,
power supply, microUSB to USB/Ethernet adapter, and Ethernet cable cost around
$100.
