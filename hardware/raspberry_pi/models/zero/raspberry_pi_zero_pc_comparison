The processing speed of the ARM1176JZF-S CPU, introduced in 2003 and running at
1 GHz in the Raspberry Pi Zero, is approximately equivalent to that of the
fastest Pentium II (450 MHz) that Intel produced, starting in 1998.  A name
brand (Compaq Presario) complete Pentium II PC system with 450 MHz processor,
128 MB of RAM, 10 GB hard drive, and 17 inch monitor cost $2500 in 1998.  With
512 MB of RAM and no monitor, the price would also have been around $2500.

In 2015 when the Raspberry Pi Zero was introduced, the board together with a 16
GB microSD card, keyboard, mouse, case, power supply, microUSB to USB/Ethernet
adapter, and Ethernet cable cost around $100.  Adding a monitor would double
the price, but the Raspberry Pi Zero like all Raspberry Pi computers can be run
"headless" (no keyboard, mouse, or monitor).

In 2021, when used in USB gadget mode and connected to a separate desktop
computer, the Raspberry Pi Zero ($5) with a 32 GB microSD card ($8), official
case ($9), micro USB to USB-A cable for power and networking ($5), GPIO header
($0.95), and USB to TTL serial console cable ($10) cost less than $40, with
soldering required to attach the header to the board.  A minimal working
configuration would require only the Raspberry Pi Zero board ($5), 16 GB
microSD card ($6.50), and micro USB to USB-A cable ($5) and would cost less
than $20.
