This procedure configures a Raspberry Pi Zero to be used as an Ethernet over
USB gadget, connected to a Macintosh computer's USB port either directly or
through a USB hub.

On the Raspberry Pi Zero:

Add the following line to /boot/config.txt:
dtoverlay=dwc2

Add the following to the boot command line in /boot/cmdline.txt:
modules-load=dwc2,g_ether

Configure interface usb0 instead of eth0 in /etc/dhcpcd.conf.  For example:
interface usb0
static ip_address=192.168.2.2/24
static routers=192.168.2.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.2.1
static domain_search=solarcore.net

Connect the Raspberry Pi Zero from its USB OTG port (instead of the power port)
to a USB port (or hub) on the Mac.

On the Mac:

Once the Pi Zero is booted, a device "RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget" will appear in
System Preferences -> Network

In System Preferences -> Network, select this device and set "Configure IPv4"
to "Off"

In System Preferences -> Sharing -> Internet Sharing, select this device in
the "To computers using" list.

In order for DNS resolution to work properly on the USB gadget through the
Mac's mDNS server, it may be necessary to bounce the mDNSResponder and mDNSResponderHelper services on the Mac:

# launchctl list | grep -i mdns  (use the service names in the commands below)
# launchctl stop com.apple.mDNSResponderHelper.reloaded
# launchctl stop com.apple.mDNSResponder.reloaded
# launchctl start com.apple.mDNSResponder.reloaded
# launchctl start com.apple.mDNSResponderHelper.reloaded
