From official Raspberry Pi documentation for /boot/config.txt variables:

over_voltage

CPU/GPU core voltage adjustment. [-16,8] equates to [0.8V,1.4V] with 0.025V
steps; in other words, specifying -16 will give 0.8V as the GPU/core voltage,
and specifying 8 will give 1.4V. The default value is 0 (1.2V). Values above 6
are only allowed when force_turbo or current_limit_override are specified; this
sets the warranty bit.
