Hardware connections:

Connect TTL leads to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header as follows:

Top row pins:
3rd: black (ground)
4th: white (Pi transmit / cable receive)
5th: green (Pi receive / cable transmit)

If 3rd pin on top row is not available, alternate ground is 5th pin from the
left on the bottom row.
