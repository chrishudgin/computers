To reset the MEBx password to the default value ("admin"), move the jumper from
the PSWD (Password) pins to the RTCRST (Real Time Clock Reset) pins on the
motherboard, power up the computer for at least ten seconds, turn it back off,
and move the jumper back to PSWD.

To clear the BIOS Admin Password (if set), remove the jumper from the PSWD
(Password) pins and power on the computer.  The jumper must be put back over
the PSWD pins before you can set a new BIOS Admin Password.
