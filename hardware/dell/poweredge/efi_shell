There is no UEFI shell built in to Dell 11th generation PowerEdge servers
(R210, etc).  These servers use UEFI 2.1, which requires a 1.x version of the
UEFI shell.

To boot to a UEFI shell, use Linux to partition a Dell virtual
flash drive or USB thumb drive and format it as vfat, then copy a UEFI shell
executable to the partition as:

EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI

In the UEFI Boot Manager menu, select the device and it will boot to the shell.
