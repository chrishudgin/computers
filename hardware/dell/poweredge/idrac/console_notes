On macOS, allow F11 and F12 function keys to be sent to virtual console:
System Preferences -> Mission Control -> Show Desktop and Show Dashboard: -
(defaults are F11 and F12, respectively)

*****

It is possible to redirect console I/O to the iDRAC command line (available
through ssh to the system controller), as follows:

In the BIOS setup screen (F2 after power-cycle), Serial Communications,
choose:
                o Serial Communication : On with Console Redirection via COM2
                o Serial Port Address : Serial Device1=COM1,Serial Device2=COM2
                o External Serial Connector : Serial Device 2
                o Failsafe Baud Rate : 115200  (57600 on RHEL 6?)
                o Remote Terminal Type : VT100/VT220
                o Redirection After Boot: Disabled  (Enabled on RHEL 6?)

If connecting through ssh in the macOS Terminal application, set $TERM to xterm
rather than the default xterm-256color, or else the backspace character will
not work in the iDRAC command line session:

$ TERM=xterm ssh root@r210-sc

Log into system controller through ssh and run:
racadm getconfig -g cfgSerial

If necessary, change values:
racadm config -g cfgSerial -o cfgSerialBaudRate 115200
racadm config -g cfgSerial -o cfgSerialCom2RedirEnable 1
racadm config -g cfgSerial -o cfgSerialSshEnable 1
racadm config -g cfgSerial -o cfgSerialConsoleEnable 1

Connect to the console:
console com2  (only com2 is available for redirection to iDRAC command line)

After you have logged into the OS through the console, you may find that the
terminal's automatic margins feature (line wrap) is not enabled.  Automatic
margins can be enabled with:
$ tput reset
or more specifically:
$ tput smam
(The inverse operation is tput rmam; see terminfo(5) for details.)

Disconnect from the console and return to iDRAC command line:
Ctrl-\

To configure redirection of the Linux console to COM2, modify grub.conf or
grub.cfg to add

console=ttyS1,115200n8

to the kernel command line entry.
