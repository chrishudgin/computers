Setting the iDRAC NIC to dedicated (for iDRAC Enterprise cards) rather than
shared can be done in either of two ways:

1. If the iDRAC is accessible over the LAN, log into the iDRAC web console
and select:
   iDRAC Settings -> Network/Security
      Network Settings, NIC Selection: Dedicated
      At bottom of page:  Apply

2. If the iDRAC is not accessible over the LAN, attach a monitor, keyboard, and
mouse and reboot the server.  During the normal hardware initialization
sequence, press <Ctrl-E> when prompted to enter the iDRAC configuration
utility.

Under LAN Parameters, set NIC Selection: Dedicated
<Esc>, save changes and exit
