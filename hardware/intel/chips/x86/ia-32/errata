Volume 2 

On page 3-191, in the "Description" section, the DIVPD instruction is
erroneously described as performing divisions on four packed double precision
floating-point values in each operand.  In fact, DIVPD performs divisions on
two packed double precision floating-point values in each operand, as shown in
the "Operation" section.  The XMM registers can each hold only two packed
double precision floating-point values at 64 bits each for a total of 128 bits
in the each XMM register.
